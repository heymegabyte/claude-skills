# 12 — Build-Breaking Media + Orchestration Rules

> **Model migration note (pass-75, 2026-06-09)**: References to `DALL-E 3` / `DALL-E` migrated to **GPT Image 1.5** (current OpenAI image-gen flagship); `GPT-4o` vision migrated to **GPT Image 2 vision** (current OpenAI multimodal flagship). Per `platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations`: DALL-E 2/3 removed from API 2026-05-12; GPT-4o retired 2026-02-13. 14-Ideogram leverage slot manifest, 16-source parallel multimedia fan-out, and topic-relevance ≥8/10 gates all unchanged — only API endpoint names updated. Cost ranges in this doc were computed against legacy DALL-E + GPT-4o pricing; re-verify against current GPT Image 1.5 / GPT Image 2 rates.

Migrated from `~/.claude/rules/always.md` 2026-05-03.

## Every image slot (***MEDIA SLOT MANIFEST + FAIL-CLOSED AUTO-REGENERATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — supersedes "fetch-some-images-and-pick-later" patterns***)

Phase 0 step 1 enumerates EVERY image slot on EVERY route into `_media_slots.json` BEFORE any agent fans out.

### Slot record shape

```
{slot_id, route, section, role, aspect, min_dims, topic_keywords, topic_intent,
 brand_palette, preferred_motion, source_chain, dalle_prompt, negative_prompt,
 relevance_floor, filled_by, filled_url, filled_score, regen_attempts}
```

### Per-slot GPT Image 1.5 prompt — 6 mandatory fields

Drafted at this stage (single batched gpt-4o call ~$0.05/site) MUST encode:

1. Page topic + intent verbatim
2. Brand palette tokens inline hex
3. Composition + aspect ratio
4. Subject specificity (NEVER `"people"` — always `"octogenarian volunteer plating soup, soft window light, documentary style"`)
5. Photographic technical specs (camera/lens/lighting/DoF — e.g. `"shot on Hasselblad, 85mm prime, golden hour, shallow DoF"`)
6. Negative prompt block (`"no text, no watermarks, no logos, no extra fingers, no AI artifacts, no stock-photo cliches"`)

### Source-chain order

1. Real-entity sources (Places/uploads/scrape)
2. GPT Image 1.5
3. Pexels
4. Coverr
5. Flux
6. Brand-gradient

GPT Image 1.5 elevated to PRIMARY slot-fill engine after real-entity exhaustion (Brian: *"GPT Image 1.5 can literally create the ultra-realistic perfect photo for any given photo spot, so rely on that fact"*). Stock APIs run as parallel speed-pass fallback (instant return if GPT Image 1.5 hangs >15s) but GPT Image 1.5 output preferred at curation.

### Acceptance

Every slot MUST end the build with `filled_url != null AND filled_score >= relevance_floor` (default 8/10 GPT Image 2 vision).

### Failure handling

Failure (Pexels empty, NSFW flag, broken scrape, vision below floor) → REFINED-prompt regen via GPT Image 1.5 (gpt-4o synthesizes refined prompt from `(original_prompt, vision_critique, relevance_floor)`), max 5 attempts × $0.08/img = $0.40/slot worst case. After exhaustion: log to `_unfillable_slots.json`, ship with brand-gradient floor (prevents 404), build marked `published_with_warnings`, dashboard surfaces slot for manual replacement.

NEVER silent skip, NEVER substitute brand-gradient unless 5 regen attempts exhausted.

### Validators

- `validate-media-slot-manifest.mjs` — every route enumerated, every slot record complete
- `validate-no-empty-slots.mjs` — no `_unfillable_slots.json` entries on clean build, no slot below relevance_floor, no fallback-gradient unless exhaustion logged
- `validate-dalle-slot-fill.mjs` — every GPT Image 1.5 prompt has all 6 mandatory fields

Daily GPT Image 1.5 spend tracked in `_dalle_daily.json` against `OPENAI_DAILY_BUDGET` env (default $50) — exhaustion triggers Flux fallback for remainder of day.

Reference: lone-mountain-global-3 + njsk-light + many shipped with empty slots, off-topic generic stock, generic "create a hero image" prompts. This rule replaces the entire fetch-and-hope pattern with a deterministic enumerate-then-fill-then-verify pipeline.

## Every site (***NOTEBOOKLM ARTIFACTS — PODCAST + INFOGRAPHIC + EXPLAINER VIDEO — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — `notebooklm-orchestrator` agent runs Phase 0***)

Every site ships THREE auto-generated NotebookLM-style artifacts before deploy:

1. **Two-host audio podcast** — rendered on `/about` via `<audio>` Plyr embed + collapsible inline transcript + dual JSON-LD (`PodcastSeries` + `PodcastEpisode` with `partOfSeries` + `associatedMedia` + `transcript`) + matching RSS feed `/podcast.xml` (RSS 2.0 + iTunes namespace + podcast namespace 1.0, `<enclosure type="audio/mpeg">` + `<itunes:duration>` + `<podcast:transcript>` + `<podcast:chapters>`) + 3000×3000 JPEG cover art (Apple-required)
2. **Infographic gallery** — rendered on `/about` via `[data-infographic-gallery]` containing ≥3 panels (mandatory mix: 1 data chart via Vega-Lite SVG from `_research.json.stats[]` + 1 process/flow panel via Recraft v3 SVG + 1 hero illustration via GPT Image 2 PNG with brand-converged per-slot prompt encoding all 6 mandatory fields per skill 12), each panel `data-zoomable` + `data-gallery="infographic"` + `data-caption-title` + `data-caption-description` per always.md "Every multi-image section" rule
3. **Explainer video** — rendered BTF (second `<section>` inside `<main>`, immediately after hero) on `/` homepage via `[data-section="explainer-btf"]` containing `<stream src="<UID>" controls preload="metadata" poster="<R2>" primary-color="<brand-accent>" defaultTextTrack="en">` (Cloudflare Stream embed) + `<figcaption>` + collapsible inline transcript + JSON-LD `VideoObject` with `name` + `description` + `thumbnailUrl` + `contentUrl` + `embedUrl` + `uploadDate` + `duration` + `transcript` + `hasPart` chapters array (3-7 `Clip` entries with `startOffset` + `endOffset` + `url#t=N`)

Phase 0 step 2 enumerates `_notebooklm.json` manifest (mirrors Media Slot Manifest pattern) BEFORE Phase 1 page builds reference artifact URLs.

### Provider chains

- **Podcast** — ElevenLabs Studio Create Podcast (`POST /v1/studio/podcasts` with `mode: conversation` + two voice IDs) → AutoContent API → `teng-lin/notebooklm-py` headless wrapper (only when client demands NotebookLM-format proof) → skip-with-warning
- **Video** — HeyGen API ($1/min standard, $4/min Avatar IV 1080p, 60-90s talking-head) → Synthesia → Tavus → Veo 3.1 Fast 8s hero loop ($1.20) → skip-with-warning
- **Infographic** — Vega-Lite (free deterministic) + Recraft v3 ($0.04/SVG) + GPT Image 2 ($0.06/img); fallback to Napkin AI ($39/mo) when Recraft + GPT-Image saturated

### Budgets

- Per-site cost ceiling — $3.50
- Daily ceiling — `NOTEBOOKLM_DAILY_BUDGET` (default $300 = ~100 sites) — exhaustion degrades to cheapest providers, NEVER blocks deploy

### Acceptance

Every artifact MUST end the build with `filled_url != null AND filled_score >= 8/10` (GPT Image 2 vision for cover art, gpt-4o-mini topical-relevance for transcript) OR exhausted-with-warning state — same fail-CLOSED auto-regenerate pattern as Media Slot Manifest, max 3 attempts per artifact.

### Source brief construction

gpt-4o-mini condenses `_research.json` + top-N `_corpus.json` + `_pdf_facts.json` into 8-15K-char `_podcast_source.md` (human-reviewable); same brief feeds 75-second `_video_script.md` synthesis (gpt-4o, structured Hook 10s → Problem 15s → Solution 30s → Proof 10s → CTA 10s).

### Submission automation (post-deploy)

- Apple Podcasts Connect (JWT API, `APPLE_PODCAST_KEY_ID` + `APPLE_PODCAST_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- Spotify for Podcasters (manual UI)
- Podcast Index (free instant `https://podcastindex.org/add`)
- Amazon Music Podcasters
- YouTube Music podcast directory (Google Podcasts deprecated 2024)

### Validators

- `validate-podcast-on-about.mjs` — `<audio>` + dual JSON-LD + transcript ≥500 chars on `/about`
- `validate-infographic-on-about.mjs` — `[data-infographic-gallery]` ≥3 panels with caption attrs on `/about`
- `validate-explainer-video-btf.mjs` — `[data-section="explainer-btf"]` is 2nd `<section>` of `<main>` on `/` + `<stream>` + VideoObject JSON-LD with hasPart chapters
- `validate-podcast-rss.mjs` — `/podcast.xml` 200 + valid RSS 2.0 + ≥1 `<item>` with audio enclosure

Pipeline spec: `~/.agentskills/12-media-orchestration/notebooklm-pipeline.md`. Agent: `~/.claude/agents/notebooklm-orchestrator.md`.

## Every page-rendered image (***TOPIC-RELEVANCE GATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — vision-LLM scored***)

Every `<img>` rendered on a route MUST score ≥8/10 on per-page semantic relevance via GPT Image 2 vision.

### Scoring prompt names

- (a) Page topic + intent (e.g. `/volunteer` = "people contributing time/labor", `/women-and-children-services` = "women + children specifically NOT mixed-gender adults")
- (b) Image subject + composition extracted via vision
- (c) Brand-tone fit

Lightbulb on `/volunteer` = fail. Mixed-gender adults on `women-and-children-services` = fail. Generic stock corporate handshake on soup-kitchen page = fail.

### Hero image preference order (STRICT)

1. Original-source-hero IF quality ≥7/10 (NEVER lucky-stock instead — Brian's njsk-light hero critique 2026-05-02)
2. Pexels-video-loop matching topic
3. Pexels-image scoring ≥8
4. GPT Image 1.5 per-slot prompt naming page topic + brand palette + subject specificity
5. Brand-gradient fallback

Validator (`validate-image-relevance.mjs`): post-build, GPT Image 2 vision scores `(page_topic, image_description) → relevance 0-10` for every image on every route; FAIL any score <8.

## Every blog/article post (***FEATURED IMAGE MANDATORY + GPT Image 1.5 FALLBACK — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every page-rendered image"***)

Every blog/news/article/journal/case-study post MUST have a valid featured image (hero + OG card + listing thumbnail).

### Discovery chain

1. Source post `<img>` with class containing `featured`/`hero`/`thumb`
2. Source post first inline `<img>` ≥1024×768
3. Source post `og:image` meta
4. Source post `twitter:image` meta
5. Pexels search by post title keywords (≥3 stop-word-filtered nouns)
6. Pixabay search same keywords
7. GPT Image 1.5 generation with per-slot prompt naming:
   - (a) post topic + 3 most-relevant nouns from title
   - (b) brand palette inline hex
   - (c) 16:9 aspect for hero / 1.91:1 for OG / 4:3 for listing thumbnail
   - (d) photographic specs (`"editorial photography, soft natural light, shallow DoF, documentary style"`)
   - (e) negative prompt block (no text, no watermarks, no logos, no AI artifacts)

When source-post-image is broken (404 / 5xx / mixed-content / blocked CDN), SKIP that source and continue chain — never ship a broken `<img>` even if source had one.

Vision-LLM scores final image ≥8/10 topic relevance per "Every page-rendered image" rule before accepting; below 8 → regen with refined prompt up to 3 attempts.

Validator (`validate-blog-featured-images.mjs`): every `_corpus.json.posts[]` entry MUST have `featured_image_url` set to a 200-OK file in build output; every `<article>` rendered tile MUST have a `<img>` rendering ≥1024×768; OG card 1200×630 ≤100KB.

## Every migrated source-site asset (***R2 SELF-HOSTING — NEVER HOTLINK SQUARESPACE/WIX/WP CDNS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every image/video/PDF/font/CSS/JS reference inherited from the source site MUST be downloaded during scrape and re-uploaded to R2 under `sites/<slug>/assets/<deterministic-hash>.<ext>` BEFORE rebuild reaches `published`.

### NEVER ship

- `<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/...">`
- `<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/...">`
- `<img src="https://wp.com/...">`
- `<source src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/<id>">` (YouTube embeds OK as iframes; raw assets NOT)

### Reasons

- (a) Source site can revoke/migrate at any time, breaking our site instantly
- (b) Source CDN headers strip our caching control, hurting LCP
- (c) Hotlinks expose our generated site as "still depending on the old site" — undermines value prop

### Pipeline

1. Crawler enumerates all asset URLs into `_assets.json.external_refs[]`
2. Parallel `fetch` with REAL_UA + `Accept-Encoding: identity` for binary integrity
3. Compute SHA-256 → store under `sites/<slug>/assets/<hash>.<ext>`
4. Rewrite all dist HTML/CSS to point to `/assets/<hash>.<ext>` (served via custom hostname or `*.projectsites.dev`)
5. Augment with augmented assets per skill 12 media-acquisition

YouTube/Vimeo iframes preserved as-is (those are intentional embeds, not asset hotlinks).

Validator (`validate-no-cdn-hotlinks.mjs`): grep dist/ HTML for hostnames matching `squarespace-cdn|squarespace.com|wixstatic|wix.com|wp.com|wpcomstaging|files.wordpress|cdn.shopify|images.weserv|res.cloudinary` — any match outside whitelist (analytics, fonts, Google CSE) = fail with diagnostic showing source HTML location + suggested local-asset path.

## Every page (media density — ***FAVOR VIDEO + MULTI-SOURCE GENERATION***)

Every page receives at minimum:

1. ALL original media from corresponding source URL (images, videos, PDFs preserved)
2. 1-2 supplemental GPT Image 1.5 / GPT-Image purpose-crafted originals (per-slot prompts per skill 12)
3. ≥1 Pexels Video API result for hero/module background (favor video over static for hero slots — `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline poster>`)
4. Google Image Search top-3 HIGHLY-relevant images filtered by topic match score (vision-LLM rates relevance 0-10, threshold ≥8)

Hero background preference order: original-source-hero-image → Pexels-video-loop → Pexels-image → GPT Image 1.5-generated → solid-brand-gradient. Never ship a hero with no media.

## Every image (***BUSINESS-TYPE SEMANTIC MISMATCH — FAIL CLOSED — extends topic-relevance gate — BUILD-BREAKING***)

GPT Image 2 vision topic-relevance ≥8/10 is necessary but NOT sufficient. A second binary check MUST run:

> Is this image physically compatible with what a `<business_type>` business would show?

E.g. clothing/shirts on a box factory = fail; ambulance on a bakery = fail; tropical beach on an accounting firm = fail.

### Prompt pattern

- (a) Business category: `<_research.json.category>`
- (b) Business type description: `<_research.json.business_type_description>`
- (c) Image subject extracted by vision: `<vision_description>`

Answer YES or NO: Is this image showing something that belongs on a website for this business category?

Any NO → regen with prompt refinement explicitly naming the category and physically appropriate subject.

Build gate (`validate-business-type-image-match.mjs`): every `[data-slot]` image runs a second GPT Image 2 vision-mini call (cheaper, faster) classifying YES/NO category fit — any NO in final build output = fail with slot ID, image URL, and rejection reason logged.

## Every site rebuild with known source domain (***PRIMARY DOMAIN MEDIA EXTRACTION MANDATORY — BEFORE ANY AI GENERATION***)

Before invoking GPT Image 1.5 or any stock API, crawler MUST fully extract ALL media from the source business domain (not only the pages scraped, but every image/video/PDF linked or embedded across the full site).

For `megabyte.space → megabytespace`, for `installdoctor.com → installdoctor`, for `nyfoldingbox.com → nyfoldingbox` — the primary domain is the single richest source of on-brand, topic-correct, legally-sound imagery.

### Extraction pipeline

1. Firecrawl/Playwright deep crawl primary domain with REAL_UA
2. Extract every `<img src>`, `<picture>`, `<video poster>`, `<source src>`, CSS `background-image` URL, `og:image`, JSON `image` fields
3. Filter: keep ≥200×200px, ≥10KB, non-icon/sprite/tracking-pixel
4. Download + R2 self-host (never hotlink per existing CDN-hotlink rule)
5. Run every extracted image through GPT Image 2 vision topic-relevance + business-type-match gate
6. Target: `source_image_count × 1.5` minimum total images in build (extracted + AI-generated supplements)

NEVER start AI image generation until step (5) exhausted. `_media_slots.json` MUST show `filled_by: "source_extract"` for every slot filled by real extraction before `filled_by: "dalle"` or `filled_by: "pexels"` slots get used.

Validator (`validate-source-media-extraction.mjs`): when `_research.json.source_domain` set, assert `_assets.json.extracted_images.length >= 1` (at least one image pulled from source domain before AI generation ran).

## Every team headshot (***1:1 SQUARE CROP + CONSISTENT STYLE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every person/staff/team member photo MUST be:

- (a) Square aspect ratio (1:1), face centered, cropped at shoulder level — never portrait (4:5, 3:4) or landscape — unless the full team page uses a SINGLE consistent non-square format
- (b) Consistent style across ALL team members (same background tone, same crop framing, same shadow/border treatment) — never a mix of office photos + LinkedIn headshots + casual outdoor shots in the same grid
- (c) Resolution ≥400×400px source, served at 200×200 minimum rendered size
- (d) When source site has real headshots: download, AI-crop to 1:1 square (Sharp `gravity: 'face'` or `sharp().resize(600,600,{fit:'cover', position:'face'})`), upload to R2
- (e) When source site has NO headshot for a team member: GPT Image 1.5 generates a professional headshot matching the person's name/gender inference from research — prompt pattern: `"Professional headshot of [gender]-presenting person in [industry-appropriate attire], neutral gray background, soft studio lighting, 1:1 square crop, photorealistic, Hasselblad quality, no text, no watermarks"` — NEVER ship a team card without a photo
- (f) Face detection required — if Sharp face-detect returns 0 faces, reject the image and regenerate

Validator (`validate-team-headshots.mjs`): for every `[data-card-type=person]` element, assert `<img>` exists with natural aspect ratio between 0.9 and 1.1 AND rendered bounding-rect is square within 5%.

## Every listing-grid image (***CONSISTENT ASPECT RATIO WITHIN GRID — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

All `<img>` elements within a single `[data-card-grid]` container MUST share the SAME aspect ratio — 16:9 OR 4:3 OR 1:1 (pick one per grid, determined at Phase 0 based on content type):

- Portraits → 1:1
- Products → 4:3
- Hero/feature → 16:9

Mixed aspect ratios in one grid (some cards at 16:9, others at 4:3, others at uncropped natural) create a broken, unprofessional grid rhythm.

### Implementation

- All images within a grid are cropped to the grid's target aspect using Sharp `fit:'cover'` BEFORE upload to R2 — images are NEVER CSS-cropped via `object-fit: cover` alone without actual crop (CSS object-fit distorts when natural ratio differs greatly from target)
- `<figure>` around each grid image uses CSS `aspect-ratio: 16/9` (or equivalent) as a size placeholder

Validator (`validate-grid-image-aspect.mjs`): for every `[data-card-grid]`, compute `getBoundingClientRect()` of each `<img>` inside — if `max(width/height) - min(width/height) > 0.05` across images = fail (aspect ratio too inconsistent).

## Every page render (***ALT-TEXT DEDUP BAN — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

No two `<img>` elements on the same rendered route may share identical alt text (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized).

### Reasons

- Duplicate alts mislead screen readers (user hears "team photo" three times in a row, can't distinguish which person)
- Kill image-search SEO (Google de-dupes images sharing alt within same page → only one indexed)
- Reveal AI-generated boilerplate (`"placeholder"` / `"image"` / `"photo"` repeated)

Template ships `src/lib/altText.ts` with `dedupeAltText<T>(assets)` that appends caption/context suffix on duplicate (e.g. `"Team photo — Sarah Chen, CTO"` vs `"Team photo — Marcus Lee, founder"`) and `findDuplicateAlts<T>()` for validation. `deriveAltFromSrc(src)` provides last-resort titleization fallback when alt missing.

Build pipeline rule: every loop rendering `<img>` from a data array MUST pipe the array through `dedupeAltText()` before mapping to JSX — never `.map(a => <img alt={a.alt} />)` raw.

Validator (`validate-alt-dedup.mjs`): per-route DOM walk extracts every `<img alt>`, normalizes (`alt.trim().toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ')`), counts occurrences, fails on any duplicate AND on any empty alt that lacks `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"`.

## Every route (***PER-ROUTE OG IMAGE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every route MUST have a UNIQUE `og:image` (and matching `twitter:image`) — no shared site-wide `og-image.png` across routes. Each route's social card is 1200×630 ≤100KB branded composition naming the page topic in headline + branded background + logomark + accent gradient.

### Discovery chain for per-route OG image

1. When route has a hero image meeting topic-relevance ≥8/10, composite hero into 1200×630 with branded gradient overlay + page title text + logomark
2. Else, render branded card via Satori/Resvg SSR or Vercel OG Image API or Bannerbear API with template tokens `{title, eyebrow, accent, logo}` per `_brand.json`
3. Fallback: site-default OG card BUT logged to `_unfillable_og.json` for manual replacement

### File path

`sites/<slug>/og/<route-hash>.png` (deterministic — `sha256(route)` first 8 chars).

### Per-route metadata MUST point to absolute URL

- `og:image = https://<custom-hostname>/og/<route-hash>.png`
- `og:image:width = 1200`
- `og:image:height = 630`
- `og:image:type = image/png`
- `og:image:alt = "<page-specific-description>"`

Validator (`validate-route-og-image.mjs`): grep dist HTML for `<meta property="og:image" content="...">` per route, assert:

- (a) Every route has og:image set
- (b) Every og:image URL is unique across all routes (case-sensitive — same image shared across routes = fail)
- (c) Every og:image URL HEAD-200 resolves to a real file in build output
- (d) Image dimensions exactly 1200×630
- (e) File size ≤100KB

Same checks apply to `twitter:image`.

## Every inline SVG in dist/ (***SVGO COMPRESSED — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

All `<svg>` elements embedded inline in HTML or referenced as SVG files MUST pass SVGO optimization as a build step: removes unused defs, eliminates redundant attrs (`fill="none"` on `<path fill="none">`), collapses transforms, dedups shared symbols. Expected size reduction: 30-60% from raw SVG.

Build pipeline MUST run `npx svgo --multipass` on all `.svg` source files AND on all `<svg>` blocks extracted from template HTML before final bundle.

### SVGO config

```js
{ plugins: ["preset-default", { name: "removeViewBox", active: false }] }
```

Preserving `viewBox` for responsive scaling.

### Common SVGO gains

- `<rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%">` → `<rect width="100%" height="100%">`
- Duplicate `<defs>` across same-page symbol maps merged into one
- Legacy `xmlns:xlink` stripped

Validator (`validate-svgo.mjs`): compute ratio `svgo_size / original_size` for every `.svg` file in dist/ — if ratio >0.85 (less than 15% reduction achieved), flag file for manual review (may already be optimized) — if ratio === 1.0 (no optimization ran), fail.

## Every page rendering a street address (***PROGRESSIVE-ENHANCEMENT MAPS CONTEXT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every site with a physical address"***)

Every page that visually renders a street address (any `<address>` element OR `<AddressBlock>` OR string matching `\d+ [A-Z][a-z]+ (Street|St|Avenue|Ave|Road|Rd|Blvd|Lane|Ln|Drive|Dr)` rendered as page content — NOT just footer ambient NAP) MUST present that address with adjacent Google Maps visual context within the same DOM section.

**Reason** — humans contextually identify the key points of any given screen via spatial anchors — bare-text addresses force cognitive load (open new tab → paste into Maps) while inline maps deliver geographic certainty in-place.

Progressive enhancement, NOT replacement: keep the `<address>` element + dir-link per "Every address" rule, ADD the visual.

**Required adjacency** — map widget within the same `<section>` or `<aside>` as the address render OR within 1 viewport scroll on mobile (≤700px after the address).

### Three approved widget tiers (pick the one that fits the section's information density)

1. **MapTile** — 320×320 lazy-mounted thumbnail with one pin, `aspect-ratio: 1/1`, used inline beside contact cards / in `/we-need` need-tiles / in services-page location callouts (lightweight, ≤30KB rendered)
2. **MapBand** — full-bleed 16:9 or 21:9 banner with directions CTA overlay, used on `/contact` + service-detail pages + section dividers
3. **MapDossier** — split-screen 50/50 with address + hours + phone on left, interactive map on right, used on `/contact` hero and any "where to find us" feature

### Component contract

`<MapWidget variant="tile|band|dossier" address geo title aspectRatio>` shipped once in `src/components/map-widget.tsx`, never duplicated.

Lazy-mount via IntersectionObserver — iframe injected only when section enters viewport (saves 200ms LCP); placeholder is a Sharp-rendered Maps Static API PNG OR brand-gradient SVG with pin glyph until activation. Reduced-motion: no autoplay pan, static initial frame.

### Per-page count

NO MORE THAN 2 distinct map widgets per route (avoid map-soup); when 2 addresses on same page, single widget with 2 pins via `&q=` polyline encoding OR `place_id`.

### JSON-LD pairing on every page rendering an address

Same-page `LocalBusiness` / `Place` / `Organization` schema with `geo: { latitude, longitude }` matching embed coords within 50m.

The address itself remains a Google Maps directions link (`<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=<url>">`) per "Every address" rule — the map widget is ADDITIVE.

Validator (`validate-address-map-adjacency.mjs`): for every page render of an address pattern (case-insensitive grep dist HTML), assert:

- (a) Within the same `<section>`/`<aside>` ancestor there exists a `<MapWidget>` OR `<iframe src*="google.com/maps/embed">` OR `<img>` with `src*="maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap">` OR `<noscript>` map fallback
- (b) `<MapWidget>` count per route ≤2
- (c) `LocalBusiness.geo` JSON-LD present on the page

Fail codes: `address.map_adjacency_missing` | `address.map_widget_excess` | `address.geo_jsonld_missing`.

**Footer NAP exemption** — the always-present footer-block address (site-wide, ambient) requires only the single small footer embed per the parent rule below — it does NOT trigger this per-section adjacency rule.

## Every site with a physical address (***FULL-WIDTH GOOGLE MAPS WIDGET — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING for local-business + non-profit + restaurant + medical + retail + any site with NAP***)

Every site whose `_research.json` resolves a street address renders ONE full-width interactive map widget on `/contact` (mandatory) AND mirrors a smaller embed in the footer (recommended).

### Implementation

MUST use Google Maps Embed API via `<iframe>` (no JS-API key required for basic embeds, free unlimited loads, no CSP `script-src` change needed) — NOT the Maps JavaScript API (key-gated, billable, heavier bundle).

URL pattern:

```
https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key=<MAPS_EMBED_KEY>&q=<urlencoded-address>&zoom=15&maptype=roadmap
```

The `MAPS_EMBED_KEY` is set via `wrangler secret put MAPS_EMBED_KEY --env production` (Embed API free tier: unlimited loads as of 2026, billable Maps JS API counts separately).

### Component

`<MapWidget address geo aspectRatio="16/9" title="Map showing <business-name>">` shipped in template, lazy-mounted via IntersectionObserver (iframe injected only when in viewport — saves 200ms LCP):

- `loading="lazy"`
- `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`
- `allowfullscreen`
- `aria-label="Interactive map showing <address>"`
- Wrapped in `<figure>` with `<figcaption>` linking the address (uses `<AddressBlock>` so the address itself remains a Google Maps directions link per "Every address" rule above)

`<noscript>` fallback renders Maps Static API image:

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=<lat>,<lng>&zoom=15&size=1200x675&markers=color:red%7C<lat>,<lng>&key=<MAPS_STATIC_KEY>
```

### Reduced-motion

Embed API auto-respects user pan/zoom intent — no extra config.

### CSP additions

- For SERVED sites already permissive (`frame-src *` via `default-src *` in security_headers.ts)
- For DASHBOARD CSP: append `frame-src https://www.google.com https://maps.google.com` if widget renders in dashboard

### JSON-LD pairing

`LocalBusiness` schema on the same page MUST include `geo: { @type: "GeoCoordinates", latitude, longitude }` matching the embedded map exactly (latitude + longitude rounded to 5 decimals = ~1.1m precision) — AI search engines cross-reference structured data against visual map.

### Mapbox GL JS alternative

Brand-themable alternative when palette cohesion outranks ubiquity (50k loads/month free, requires `MAPBOX_TOKEN`, supports custom dark-mode style matching site palette) — choose Mapbox when `_brand.json.theme==="dark" AND brand_consistency_priority>0.8`, else Google Maps Embed.

### Dark-theme CSS filter (Google Maps Embed only)

When `_brand.json.theme === "dark"` AND Mapbox is NOT chosen, wrap `<iframe>` in `<div class="map-wrapper" data-theme="dark">` and apply:

```css
filter: invert(90%) hue-rotate(180deg) saturate(0.5) contrast(1.1);
```

Approximates dark-mode map without Mapbox; the invert re-inverts satellite imagery poorly so force `maptype=roadmap`.

### Custom logo marker pin

When `_research.json.address_lat` + `_research.json.address_lng` are known AND `_brand.json.logo.original_icon_url` resolves HEAD-200:

1. Download logo icon
2. Sharp composite: 80×80 white circle bg, logo centered 50×50 with `fit:inside`, then append SVG downward-pointing equilateral triangle 20×20 below as pin stem (centered, matching brand accent color), save as `sites/<slug>/assets/map-marker.png`
3. Upload to R2 at `sites/<slug>/assets/map-marker.png`
4. Append `&markers=icon:<absolute-r2-url-to-marker>%7C<lat>,<lng>` to Embed URL OR inject custom icon via Mapbox `addImage` + `addLayer`

Fallback to `&markers=color:red%7C<lat>,<lng>` when logo unavailable.

Validator (`validate-google-maps-widget.mjs`): for every site with `_research.json.address` set, asserts:

- (a) `<iframe src*="google.com/maps/embed">` OR `<div data-mapbox>` present on `/contact`
- (b) iframe `width` resolves to ≥90vw at desktop
- (c) JSON-LD `LocalBusiness.geo` lat/lng matches embed `q` resolved coords within 50m
- (d) When `_brand.json.theme==="dark"`, iframe has `filter` style applied

Fail codes: `map.embed_missing` | `map.not_full_width` | `map.geo_mismatch` | `map.dark_theme_filter_missing`.

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #1 — ≥3 DISTINCT MEDIA TYPES PER ROUTE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every page-rendered route MUST present ≥3 distinct media types — text-only pages are BUILD FAIL.

### Allowed types

- Photograph (GPT Image 1.5 OR real-entity)
- Illustration/icon system
- Video (hero OR embedded clip)
- Audio (podcast OR voiceover OR ambient OR sound effect)
- Data visualization (chart OR infographic OR animated counter)
- 3D/WebGL (Three.js OR Spline embed OR particle field)
- Interactive widget (calculator OR quiz OR map OR timeline scrubber)
- Generative SVG (animated brand pattern)

### Distribution

- Hero — 1 media
- Feature section — 1-2 media
- Final CTA section — 1 media

Validator (`validate-multimedia-density.mjs`): grep dist HTML per route, assert ≥3 distinct types in: `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<svg>` with animation, `<canvas>`, `<iframe data-media-embed>`.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #25 (2026-05-10) — text-only sites cannot meet Mission Doctrine cinematic floor.

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #2 — VIDEO-FIRST IN HERO + 1 PER 1000 WORDS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST ship ≥1 hero video (per Cinematic Floor #1) AND ≥1 additional embedded video per ~1000 words of body content.

### Source order

1. Source-site original videos (R2 self-hosted)
2. Sora generation (premium tier)
3. Coverr royalty-free
4. Pexels free 4K
5. AI-generated explainer video via HeyGen (founder profile only)

All videos MUST be MP4 H.264 OR WebM VP9 ≤4MB, lazy-loaded via `<video preload="metadata">` + `loading="lazy"` (when supported), `autoplay+muted+playsinline+loop` ONLY for hero/ambient; embedded body videos require user-controls (`<video controls>`). HLS streams permitted for videos >4MB.

Validator (`validate-video-density.mjs`): assert hero video present AND ratio of `<video>` elements to word count ≥1:1500.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #26 (2026-05-10).

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #3 — DATA VIZ FOR EVERY QUANTITATIVE CLAIM — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every page with ≥3 quantitative claims (%, N, $, dates, comparisons) MUST surface ≥1 data visualization rendering those claims — bar chart OR line graph OR animated counter OR sparkline OR proportional treemap OR map heatmap.

### Implementation

- Chart.js (≤30KB CDN) OR vanilla SVG (zero JS) OR observablehq embed OR D3.js (premium tier)
- Visualization MUST tie to APA-cited data per `~/.claude/rules/citations.md` — viz title cites source inline

Validator (`validate-quantitative-data-viz.mjs`): grep dist HTML for ≥3 quantitative patterns (`\d+%`, `\$\d+[KMB]`, `\d+x`, `\d+ (years|users|customers|countries)`) on a page, assert page contains ≥1 `<canvas data-chart>` OR `<svg data-viz>` OR `<dl data-stat-grid>` element AND viz includes APA citation in caption/footnote.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #27 (2026-05-10).

## Every page (***MULTIMEDIA DENSITY #4 — AUDIO PRESENCE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — homepage minimum***)

Every site's homepage MUST embed ≥1 audio asset: NotebookLM podcast episode OR ElevenLabs founder voiceover OR audio brief OR ambient brand sound OR audio testimonial.

Player ships per skill-12 NotebookLM artifacts rule — `<audio controls preload="metadata">` with transcript expander for accessibility (WCAG 2.2 1.2.1 prerecorded audio-only). Audio plays only on user-gesture (no autoplay).

Validator (`validate-audio-presence.mjs`): assert homepage `<audio>` element present + has `controls` attribute + `<details data-transcript>` OR linked `.txt` transcript file.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #28 (2026-05-10) + Mission Doctrine cinematic floor.

## Every site (***PRE-RENDER MEDIA #1 — MEDIA FETCH PARALLEL WITH RESEARCH — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Build orchestrator MUST kick off media-fetch tasks (logo extraction, source-site asset crawl, Pexels/Pixabay search, GPT Image 1.5 prompt drafting) in parallel with research phase — NOT sequentially after research completes.

**Reason** — media calls are network-bound + idempotent; running them concurrently with LLM-bound research saves ~3-5 min wall-clock per build.

Implementation: container spawns 3 worker tasks at boot — `research_task`, `brand_extraction_task`, `media_prefetch_task` — all 3 must complete before `content_synthesis_task` fires.

Validator (`validate-parallel-media-fetch.mjs`): parse build trace timestamps, assert `media_prefetch_task.started_at ≤ research_task.started_at + 5s` AND `media_prefetch_task.ended_at ≤ research_task.ended_at + 30s`.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #5 (2026-05-10) — pre-render parallelism collapses build time.

## Every site (***PRE-RENDER MEDIA #2 — GPT Image 1.5 BATCH SUBMISSION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

GPT Image 1.5 slot fill MUST batch-submit all prompts in a single concurrent burst (`Promise.all([...slots].map(generateDALLE))`) with concurrency limit of 10 (OpenAI rate limit) — NEVER sequential one-at-a-time.

Total time = max(slot generation time) ≈ 12-18s vs sum (5min+) sequential. Per-slot timeout 20s with retry-once on transient failure.

Validator (`validate-dalle-batch.mjs`): parse build trace, assert all GPT Image 1.5 API calls have overlapping `started_at` windows + max concurrent ≥5 + total GPT Image 1.5 phase duration ≤30s for ≤20 slots.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #6 (2026-05-10).

## Every site (***PRE-RENDER MEDIA #3 — MEDIA SLOT MANIFEST CACHED BY URL HASH — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — iter ≥2 incremental***)

On rebuild at `iteration_count >= 2`, build orchestrator MUST hash source-site media URL list (`sha256(sorted(source_images[]))`) and compare against `_media_slots.json[previous].source_hash`. If match: skip source-image re-download + reuse prior GPT Image 1.5 generations whose source-data lineage hash matches.

Only regenerate slots whose source data CHANGED OR whose vision-relevance score was below floor in prior iteration OR whose goody-queue entry mutates them.

Validator (`validate-media-cache-reuse.mjs`): when `iteration_count >= 2`, assert `_media_slots.json[current].slots_reused_count > 50%` of total slots AND build's GPT Image 1.5 API call count is ≤ `slots_regenerated_count`.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #7 (2026-05-10) — diff-patch iteration applied to media phase cuts cost ~$0.30 → $0.05 per rebuild.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM LEVERAGE — CADENCE + REGISTRY — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every build MUST generate ≥4 Ideogram v3 assets at slice 0 (foundation) and every progressive rebuild (iteration ≥2) MUST add ≥2 NEW Ideogram assets to the brand kit OR remix existing ones — never skip the typographic layer.

### Cadence

- Iteration 1 — 4-6 foundation assets
- Iteration 2+ — 2-3 incremental adds

### Pipeline

Brand extraction → `_brand.json` → Ideogram prompt template `(brand_name, palette, font_family, asset_role, dimensions, style="vector|editorial|stamp|poster")` → `ideogram.generate({ model: "v3-balanced", style_type, magic_prompt_option: "AUTO", rendering_speed: "QUALITY", color_palette, num_images: 4 })` → critique pass (GPT Image 2 vision ≥8/10) → R2 upload → log to `_ideogram_assets.json`.

**Sourced fallback** — if Ideogram API quota exhausted, scan source-site Wayback/live for existing branded type/posters/banners — preserve + upscale before generating.

Validator (`validate-ideogram-cadence.mjs`): assert `_ideogram_assets.json[iteration].length >= floor_for_iteration` AND every entry has `{role, prompt, r2_url, dimensions, critique_score, source: "ideogram_v3" | "source_site_preserved"}`.

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 — *"every progressive build should include a few creatively generated Ideogram assets, or sourced from pre-existing"*.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #1 — LOGO + WORDMARK + MONOGRAM SUITE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Slice 0 brand kit MUST include Ideogram-generated logo + wordmark + monogram triad — same brand mark in 3 forms for different placements.

- **Logo** — full lockup (icon + wordmark, header/footer)
- **Wordmark** — type-only (email signatures, watermarks)
- **Monogram** — initials/icon-only (favicon, app icon, social avatar, large faded BG watermark)

### Prompt template

`"<brand_name> logo design, <style_directive_from_brand_research>, <palette> color palette, vector style, transparent background, professional"`

Validator (`validate-logo-triad.mjs`): assert `_brand.json.logo.{full,wordmark,monogram}` all resolve 200 AND match brand palette ΔE≤5.

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 — Ideogram nails typography rendering where GPT Image 1.5/Midjourney fail.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #2 — FAVICON-SET GENERATOR FROM MONOGRAM — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST derive the 9-asset favicon set (`favicon.ico`, `favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `apple-touch-icon-180x180.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`, `mstile-150x150.png`, `safari-pinned-tab.svg`, `maskable-icon-1024x1024.png`) from Ideogram-rendered monogram — NEVER from automated resize of full logo (loses fidelity at 16x16).

Pipeline: Ideogram monogram @ 1024×1024 → ImageMagick downscale + sharp recompress → realfavicon API verification.

Validator (`validate-favicon-set.mjs`): assert all 9 files exist in `dist/` AND `favicon-16x16.png` retains recognizable mark (pHash distance ≤12 from 1024×1024 source).

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #3 — OG/TWITTER CARD PER ROUTE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every route MUST ship its own Ideogram-generated OG card (1200×630) AND Twitter card (1200×675) — NEVER reuse a single site-wide card. Each card features the route's H1 in brand typography over branded background pattern + brand logo lockup.

### Prompt template per route

`"social share card design, headline '<route_h1>', <brand_name> logo bottom-right, <palette>, <font_family>, 1200x630, modern editorial"`

Validator (`validate-og-card-per-route.mjs`): assert `dist/og/<route-slug>.png` exists for every `RouteMetadata.path` AND `og:image` meta points to it AND image dims === 1200×630.

Reference: per-route-metadata rule + Brian directive 2026-05-11.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #4 — HERO TYPOGRAPHIC POSTER (THESIS PLATE) — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST ship 1 hero typographic poster — large brand wordmark or thesis statement rendered as editorial-poster typography for above-the-fold accent (sits behind/beside video BG OR replaces video on low-bandwidth fallback).

### Prompt template

`"editorial poster design, large bold typography '<one_line_thesis>', <brand_name>, <palette>, abstract <theme_from_research> background motif, minimalist, magazine-cover style"`

Validator (`validate-hero-poster.mjs`): assert `_ideogram_assets.json[].role === "hero_poster"` exists with critique ≥8/10.

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 + cinematic-floor (skill 15).

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #5 — SECTION-DIVIDER CHAPTER PLATES — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Long-form pages (about, history, services, blog post >2000 words) MUST insert Ideogram-generated chapter-divider plates between major sections — typographic art renderings of section H2s.

**Floor** — 1 plate per 3 H2s on long pages.

### Prompt template

`"editorial chapter divider, large typography '<h2_text>', <brand_name> color palette, <font_family>, minimalist horizontal banner 1600x400, magazine-style section break"`

Validator (`validate-chapter-plates.mjs`): assert long-form route renders ≥`ceil(h2_count/3)` plates in DOM with `<figure data-role="chapter-plate">` AND each `<img>` resolves to a unique Ideogram asset.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #6 — EDITORIAL BLOG POST HEADERS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every blog/journal post MUST have an Ideogram-generated editorial header image (1600×900) combining post title typography + relevant visual motif — replaces the default GPT Image 1.5 stock-photo header on content-rich routes.

### Prompt template

`"editorial article header, title '<post_title>', <subject_motif_from_post_body>, <palette>, <font_family>, magazine-cover composition, 16:9"`

Validator (`validate-blog-headers.mjs`): assert every `_blog.json[].featured_image` derived from Ideogram OR explicitly tagged `source: photographic` with justification.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #7 — 404 + 500 BRANDED ERROR PAGES — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST ship Ideogram-generated 404 + 500 hero art — typography-first error pages that feel brand-native (NOT default-template "Page Not Found").

### Prompt templates

- **404** — `"playful '404' typography in <brand> style, friendly error illustration, <palette>, <brand_name> logo small bottom"`
- **500** — `"abstract '500' typography in <brand> style, calm error illustration, <palette>"`

Validator (`validate-branded-error-pages.mjs`): assert `dist/404.html` + `dist/500.html` render Ideogram-sourced hero `<img>` AND status codes 404/500 served by worker route map them.

Reference: skill 15 existing "Every site branded 404+500 error pages".

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #8 — PWA SPLASH SCREENS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST ship Ideogram-generated PWA splash screens at iOS + Android required sizes:

- **iOS** — 640x1136, 750x1334, 1242x2208, 1242x2688, 1536x2048, 1668x2388, 2048x2732
- **Android** — 320x568, 360x640, 412x732, 480x800

Each splash = monogram centered on brand-gradient BG with brand wordmark below.

### Prompt template

`"PWA splash screen, <brand_name> monogram centered, <palette> gradient background, wordmark below, <dimensions>, mobile splash design"`

Validator (`validate-pwa-splashes.mjs`): assert all 11 splash sizes resolve in `dist/splash/` AND manifest references them via `apple-touch-startup-image` + Workbox precache.

Reference: rules/pwa-checklist + brian-preferences PWA mandatory.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #9 — PRICING TIER BADGES — SaaS/MEMBERSHIP MODE — BUILD-BREAKING***)

SaaS / membership / non-profit-tier sites MUST ship Ideogram-generated tier badges (Starter/Pro/Patron/Founder/Sustainer) — embossed typographic seals NOT generic icon-pack medals.

### Prompt template per tier

`"premium membership badge design, '<tier_name>' typography, embossed style, <palette>, <brand_name> mark, circular seal, gold/silver/bronze accent for tier hierarchy"`

Validator (`validate-tier-badges.mjs`): assert pricing-page renders Ideogram badge per pricing tier in `_pricing.json.tiers[]`. Skipped on portfolio/local-business builds.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #10 — NUMBERED CHAPTER GLYPHS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every feature/process/services section with ≥3 steps MUST render Ideogram-generated numbered chapter glyphs (`"01"`, `"02"`, `"03"`...) as section markers — bold numeral typography in brand style.

### Prompt template

Validator (`validate-pattern-tile.mjs`): assert `dist/assets/pattern.png` or `pattern.svg` exists AND used in CSS as `background-image: url(...)` with `background-repeat` in ≥1 route.

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #12 — STAT-ROLLUP NUMERAL CARDS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site with quantitative trust signals (years founded, members served, projects completed, $ raised) MUST render those numerals as Ideogram-generated typography cards — NOT plain CSS-rendered numbers.

### Prompt template per stat

`"giant numeral '<value>' typography card, label '<unit>' below, <brand_name> palette, editorial poster style, 800x800, magazine cover"`

Validator (`validate-stat-numerals.mjs`): assert `_research.json.stats[]` items each have an Ideogram asset rendered in DOM with IntersectionObserver count-up animation (skill 11 rule).

Reference: skill 11 "Every stat block IO+rAF roll-in counter".

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #13 — SHAREABLE QUOTE / TESTIMONIAL CARDS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site with testimonials/quotes/manifesto MUST render social-shareable quote cards via Ideogram — 1:1 (Instagram) + 9:16 (Stories/TikTok) + 16:9 (LinkedIn).

### Prompt template

Validator (`validate-share-quote-cards.mjs`): assert every testimonial in `_testimonials.json` has ≥2 aspect variants in `dist/share/` AND share buttons download or open-in-share-sheet the matching aspect.

Reference: skill 09 "Every testimonial complete attribution".

## Every build (***IDEOGRAM SLOT #14 — PROGRESSIVE-BUILD ITERATION STAMP/SEAL — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every progressive rebuild (iteration ≥1) MUST generate an Ideogram "iteration N" stamp/seal — embossed circular mark like `"Build vN · Refined 2026-05-11 · By AI + Brian"` surfaced on `/admin/build-trace` AND as Easter-egg footer watermark on hover. Acts as cumulative goody (skill 14 idea engine + progressive-rebuild loop).

### Prompt template per iteration

`"vintage certification stamp, 'Build v<N>' typography, date '<iso_date>', <brand_name> monogram center, <palette>, circular seal, embossed gold/silver"`

Validator (`validate-iteration-stamp.mjs`): assert `_ideogram_assets.json[].role === "iteration_stamp"` increments per `sites.iteration_count`.

Validator (`validate-media-density.mjs`): assert every content section has ≥3 media items AND ≥5 distinct sources represented across the build AND every asset has license metadata + attribution rendered in `/credits` page.

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 — *"populate every single experience with as many relevant multimedia pieces that can be converged into an amazing digital immersive experience"*.

## Every build (***GOOGLE CUSTOM SEARCH IMAGE API — LICENSE-FILTERED — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every build MUST query Google Custom Search JSON API with `searchType=image` + `rights=cc_publicdomain,cc_attribute,cc_sharealike,cc_noncommercial` (commercial use filter when SaaS) for every topic in `_research.json.topics[]` + every named entity (people, places, institutions, products) in `_corpus.json`.

### API

```
https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=<GOOGLE_CSE_KEY>&cx=<GOOGLE_CSE_CX>&q=<topic>&searchType=image&rights=cc_attribute&imgSize=large&safe=active
```

### Floor

## Every build (***PODCAST GENERATION — NOTEBOOKLM + PODCAST INDEX DUAL-MODE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every build MUST produce 1 NEW NotebookLM-generated "Deep Dive" podcast episode (2-host conversation, 8-15min) per iteration AND embed ≥3 DISCOVERED relevant existing podcast episodes via Podcast Index API.

Google Podcasts API deprecated 2024 — replacements:

- (a) **NotebookLM API** for generation — `_research.json` + `_corpus.json` → uploaded as sources → trigger Audio Overview → poll for completion → download MP3 → R2 self-host → embed via custom audio player on `/about` + `/podcast` route
- (b) **Podcast Index API** (`https://podcastindex.org/`, free, no key required for search) for discovery — `GET /api/1.0/search/byterm?q=<topic_or_brand>` → filter by recency + relevance → embed top 3 via iframe player
- (c) **YouTube Data API v3** for podcast discovery on YouTube Music — `GET /search?q=<topic>+podcast&type=video&videoDuration=long`

### Pipeline

Parallel fan-out at media phase → assemble `_podcasts.json[{type:"generated|discovered", source, audio_url, transcript_url, duration_s, hosts, embed_html}]` → `/podcast` route renders chronological feed + RSS feed (`/podcast/feed.xml` per RFC 5005) → submit to Apple Podcasts + Spotify on first iteration.

Validator (`validate-podcast-presence.mjs`): assert `_podcasts.json.generated.length >= 1` per iteration AND `_podcasts.json.discovered.length >= 3` AND `/podcast/feed.xml` validates against PodcastIndex spec.

### Required keys

- `NOTEBOOKLM_API_KEY` — Google Cloud Vertex AI

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 — *"Google Podcast API is leveraged so that Podcasts are built as well"* (note: actual Google Podcasts retired; this rule routes to NotebookLM + Podcast Index + YouTube as the modern equivalents).

## Every build (***ATF VIDEO BACKGROUND — SORA + VEO + STOCK FALLBACK — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site's homepage hero AND every long-form route hero MUST ship an above-the-fold video background — visitors expect cinematic motion ATF in 2026.

### Generation cascade (parallel, take-first-success)

- (a) **OpenAI Sora 2** primary — `POST /v1/videos` with `prompt: "<brand_thesis_scene_description>, cinematic, 10s, 16:9, 1080p, no text"` + `duration_seconds: 10` + `aspect_ratio: "16:9"` → poll task → download MP4
- (b) **Google Veo 3** parallel — Vertex AI `predictLongRunning` with `prompt` + `aspectRatio:"16:9"` + `durationSeconds: 8` + `personGeneration: "allow_adult"` → poll → download
- (c) **Stock video fallback** (when generation quota/budget exhausted) — Pexels Video API `GET /videos/search?query=<theme>&orientation=landscape&size=large` OR Coverr `/api/v1/videos/search` OR Mixkit free-tier — must be CC0/permissive

### Encoding

Encode to WebM (VP9) + MP4 (H.264) at 1920×1080 + mobile 854×480, total ≤4MB per video (re-encode aggressively via ffmpeg).

### Render

```html
<video autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" poster="<ideogram_hero_poster_fallback>">

```

Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — render Ideogram poster instead. Lazy-load secondary route heroes via IntersectionObserver.

Validator (`validate-atf-video.mjs`): assert homepage hero has `<video>` with valid src AND fallback poster AND total page weight ≤5MB AND `prefers-reduced-motion` gracefully degrades.

### Required keys

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Sora
- `GCP_VEO_KEY` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` — Veo via Vertex AI
- `PEXELS_API_KEY` — stock fallback

Reference: Brian directive 2026-05-11 — *"Sora and Google Veo should be leveraged to create custom footage, for hero background images (people expect ATF video-backgrounds)"*.

## Every progressive build (***PROGRESSIVE MEDIA REFRESH — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every iteration ≥2 MUST refresh ≥1 hero video + add ≥2 NEW Ideogram assets + expand `_media_corpus.json` by ≥10 items — never re-serve identical media across iterations.

Acts as cumulative delight (skill 14 goody queue):

- **Iteration 1** — baseline Sora hero
- **Iteration 2** — Veo variant + new chapter plates
- **Iteration 3** — Sora seasonal variant + new pattern tile + new tier badges

Validator (`validate-progressive-media.mjs`): for iteration ≥2, assert `_media_corpus.json[current].length >= _media_corpus.json[prior].length + 10` AND hero video pHash differs from prior iteration's pHash.

Reference: `project_progressive_rebuild` memory + `project_creativity_doctrine` — each rebuild measurably more delightful.

## Every build (***CREDITS + ATTRIBUTION PAGE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST ship a `/credits` (or `/colophon`) route rendering full attribution for every multimedia asset — image source + license + author + URL. Sourced from `_media_corpus.json` automatically. Required by Wikimedia/CC-BY licenses + ethical defaults.

Validator (`validate-credits-page.mjs`): assert `/credits` renders ≥1 entry per `_media_corpus.json` item AND each entry has author link + license link + source URL AND robots = `index,follow` (gives SEO credit back to source).

Reference: `rules/citations` + Wikimedia attribution requirements.
