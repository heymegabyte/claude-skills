description: "Default payment processor for nonprofits, donations, one-time charges, in-person POS, and small-business e-commerce. Square Web Payments SDK (card + Apple Pay + Cash App Pay), Payments API for server-side charges, idempotency-keyed REST. Cheaper effective rates than Stripe for sub-$100 donations and nonprofit-discount accounts. Use Stripe instead when SaaS subscriptions / metered usage / Entitlements / Connect marketplaces are involved."

# Square Payments

## When Square is the Default (***FIRST DECISION — EVERY PAYMENT FEATURE***)

### Square defaults

- Nonprofits + donations (one-time OR recurring via Square Subscriptions)
- Small-business e-commerce
- Restaurant / retail / salon / medical with in-person POS need
- Event ticketing
- Sub-$100 average ticket where Stripe's $0.30 fixed is punishing
- Any client already on Square POS (single source of truth for in-person + online)
- NJ/NY local-business rebuilds where Square Retail penetration is high

### Stripe overrides

- SaaS subscriptions with seat-based / tiered / usage-based billing
- Metered billing (Stripe Billing Meters API)
- Entitlements feature gating
- Stripe Connect (marketplaces, split payments)
- Stripe Tax (40+ country auto-collection)
- Stripe Atlas formation flows
- Embedded checkout for agentic commerce (ACP launch partners)
- Enterprise contracts requiring net-30 invoicing

If ANY of these apply → Stripe; else → Square.

Hybrid is allowed: Square for donations + Stripe for SaaS subscription on the same site. Each integration owns its own webhook + DB tables — never cross-pollinate idempotency keys.

## Default Pricing Models

### Nonprofit / Donation (Square default)

Preset tiers:

- **$10** — "Feeds a family for a day"
- **$25** — "Covers supplies for a week"
- **$50** — "Powers the hotline for a month"
- **$100** — "Sponsors a full program"
- **$250** — "Transforms a life"
- **$500** — "Makes a lasting impact"
- **Custom** — "Choose your amount"

Rules:

- One-time as default frequency for small orgs (Square Subscriptions adds setup complexity)
- Monthly recurring opt-in via Square Subscriptions API + Plans (only when client has staff to manage)
- Impact labels mandatory — specific + concrete, never vague
- Progress bar showing goal achievement (optional, requires Durable Object aggregation)

### Square Nonprofit Discount

501(c)(3) organizations qualify for reduced processing: **2.2% + $0.30** vs standard **2.6% + $0.10**. Apply at `squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6358` with EIN + IRS determination letter. For $25 average donation: standard fee = $0.95, nonprofit fee = $0.85 — ~10% per-transaction savings vs Stripe (2.9% + $0.30 = $1.03).

## Web Payments SDK (Browser — Tokenize Card Client-Side)

```html
<!-- production -->
<script src="https://web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js"></script>
<!-- sandbox -->
<script src="https://sandbox.web.squarecdn.com/v1/square.js"></script>
```

```typescript
const payments = window.Square.payments(applicationId, locationId);
const card = await payments.card();
await card.attach('#square-card-container');
// On submit:
const { token, status } = await card.tokenize();
if (status !== 'OK') throw new Error('Tokenization failed');
// POST token + amount to your worker — NEVER charge from the browser
await fetch('/api/donate', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ sourceId: token, amountCents: 5000 }) });
```

Optional payment methods:

- `payments.applePay(paymentRequest)`
- `payments.cashAppPay(paymentRequest, { redirectURL })`
- `payments.googlePay(paymentRequest)`
- `payments.ach({ accountHolderName, plaidLinkToken })`

## Server-Side Charge (Cloudflare Worker — vanilla fetch)

```typescript
const SQUARE_API_VERSION = '2024-12-18';
function squareApiBase(env: Env) {
  return env.SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT === 'production'
    ? 'https://connect.squareup.com'
    : 'https://connect.squareupsandbox.com';
}

async function chargeOnce(env: Env, sourceId: string, amountCents: number, email: string, note: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`${squareApiBase(env)}/v2/payments`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Square-Version': SQUARE_API_VERSION,
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${env.SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      source_id: sourceId,
      idempotency_key: crypto.randomUUID(),
      amount_money: { amount: amountCents, currency: 'USD' },
      location_id: env.SQUARE_LOCATION_ID,
      autocomplete: true,
      buyer_email_address: email,
      note,
      reference_id: `donation-${Date.now()}`,
    }),
  });
  const body = await res.json();
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(body.errors?.[0]?.detail ?? 'Square charge failed');
  return { paymentId: body.payment.id, receiptUrl: body.payment.receipt_url };
}
```

**Idempotency** is mandatory: every charge request MUST include a unique `idempotency_key` (UUID). Retrying with the same key returns the original payment, never double-charges.

## Webhook Handler (Cloudflare Worker)

```typescript
// Verify signature via X-Square-HmacSha256-Signature header
async function verifySquareSignature(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<boolean> {
  const sig = req.headers.get('x-square-hmacsha256-signature');
  if (!sig) return false;
  const body = await req.text();
  const url = new URL(req.url).toString();
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    'raw',
    new TextEncoder().encode(env.SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY),
    { name: 'HMAC', hash: 'SHA-256' },
    false,
    ['sign']
  );
  const computed = await crypto.subtle.sign('HMAC', key, new TextEncoder().encode(url + body));
  const computedB64 = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(computed)));
  return computedB64 === sig;
}

app.post('/api/webhooks/square', async (req, env) => {
  if (!(await verifySquareSignature(req, env))) return new Response('Forbidden', { status: 403 });
  const event = await req.json();
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'payment.created':       /* record + send receipt via Resend */ break;
    case 'payment.updated':       /* status changed APPROVED → COMPLETED */ break;
    case 'refund.created':        /* notify donor + update DB */ break;
    case 'subscription.created':  /* recurring donor activated */ break;
    case 'subscription.canceled': /* retention email */ break;
  }
  return new Response('OK');
});
```

## Subscriptions (Recurring Donations)

Square Subscriptions requires a Plan + Plan Variation FIRST. Two-step setup:

```typescript
// 1. Create catalog plan (once, via wrangler or admin tool)
await fetch(`${apiBase}/v2/catalog/object`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({
    idempotency_key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    object: {
      type: 'SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN',
      id: '#monthly-25',
      subscription_plan_data: { name: 'Monthly $25 Donor' },
    },
  }),
});
// 2. Create subscription (per donor)
await fetch(`${apiBase}/v2/subscriptions`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers,
  body: JSON.stringify({
    idempotency_key: crypto.randomUUID(),
    location_id: env.SQUARE_LOCATION_ID,
    plan_variation_id: 'plan_variation_id_from_step_1',
    customer_id,        // create via /v2/customers first
    card_id,            // saved card token from cards.create
  }),
});
```

For most small nonprofits without staff to manage Plans, default to one-time charges + "donate again" CTA in receipt email. Don't add subscription complexity until the client explicitly asks.

## Environment Toggle

- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` — secret; sandbox or production
- `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID` — secret; receiving location
- `SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID` — secret; Web Payments SDK app ID (public-ish, kept as secret for env parity)
- `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT` — `"sandbox"` (default) or `"production"`
- `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY` — secret; for webhook HMAC verification

Sandbox + production accounts are separate dashboards. Get sandbox creds at `developer.squareup.com → Sandbox`; production creds at `developer.squareup.com → Production` (requires verified business). Test card in sandbox: `4111 1111 1111 1111` / any future date / any CVV / any ZIP.

## Donation Page Design (givedirectly.org energy)

### Layout

- Hero with cause story + impact stat counter (rAF roll-in, IntersectionObserver-gated)
- Amount selector grid (6 presets + custom input)
- Frequency toggle (one-time | monthly) — default one-time unless client has subscription infrastructure
- Donor form (name, email, optional address for tax receipt)
- Tribute-gift section (optional collapsed accordion: "in honor of" / "in memory of")
- Square card container `<div id="square-card-container">`
- Apple Pay / Cash App Pay buttons above card form (when enabled)
- Trust badge: "Square Secured · PCI-DSS Level 1 · 256-bit TLS"
- Turnstile invisible widget

### Post-Donation Flow

1. Success page with confetti (06/easter-eggs) + animated impact statement
2. Receipt email via Resend: thank you + tax-deductible language + Square receipt URL + "donate again" CTA
3. PostHog event: `donation_complete` with `{ amountCents, frequency, paymentMethod }`
4. Sentry breadcrumb: `donation.completed` with `paymentId` tag
5. GA4 event: `purchase` with full e-commerce schema

## Auto-Detect Square Account

When provisioning a new site, check if client has existing Square: `GET /v2/locations` returns all locations on account.

- Single location → auto-use as `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`
- Multi-location → ask which is the receiving location
- No Square account → prompt user to sign up at `squareup.com/signup` with `/agentskills` referral link (no affiliate, just direct)

## Square API Coverage

- **Payments** — `/v2/payments` — one-time charges
- **Customers** — `/v2/customers` — donor records, repeat-donor lookup
- **Cards (on file)** — `/v2/cards` — save card for recurring without storing CC
- **Subscriptions** — `/v2/subscriptions` — recurring donations (requires Plans)
- **Catalog** — `/v2/catalog/object` — Plan + Plan Variation setup
- **Refunds** — `/v2/refunds` — donor-requested refund within 60 days
- **Disputes** — `/v2/disputes` — chargeback handling
- **Locations** — `/v2/locations` — multi-location accounts
- **Orders** — `/v2/orders` — e-commerce line items (when not donation)
- **Inventory** — `/v2/inventory` — retail-tier sites only
- **Loyalty** — `/v2/loyalty` — repeat-donor rewards (rare for nonprofits)
- **Gift Cards** — `/v2/gift-cards` — holiday gift-of-meals campaigns

## Square vs Stripe Decision Cheat Sheet

- **Nonprofit donation page** → **Square** (nonprofit-rate discount, simpler UX)
- **Small biz one-time checkout** → **Square** (cheaper for sub-$100 tickets)
- **Restaurant / salon / retail with POS** → **Square** (single source of truth for in-person + online)
- **SaaS subscriptions with seats/tiers** → **Stripe** (Billing API, Entitlements, prorations)
- **Metered/usage-based AI billing** → **Stripe** (Billing Meters API, Metronome)
- **Marketplace with split payments** → **Stripe Connect**
- **Embedded checkout for AI agents** → **Stripe** (ACP launch partner with OpenAI/Perplexity)
- **Multi-country tax automation** → **Stripe Tax**
- **Net-30 enterprise invoicing** → **Stripe** (Invoicing API)
- **Donor wants to use Cash App** → **Square** (native Cash App Pay)
- **Recurring donations, no subscription complexity** → **Square** one-time + "donate again" email
- **Recurring donations, full retention machine** → either — Stripe Customer Portal is more polished, Square Subscriptions is cheaper

## Conversion Optimization (Research-Backed)

### Donation Page Best Practices (Source: NextAfter, M+R Benchmarks 2025)

- Donation page conversion rate median: 17% (NextAfter 2024). Top 10%: 30%+.
- Suggested amount with social proof: "$25 — most common gift this month" lifts AOV 12%
- One-time as default for new donors converts higher than monthly default (lowers commitment friction)
- Cash App Pay adds 8-15% to total donations on Gen Z / Millennial audiences (Cash App user base)
- Apple Pay reduces mobile abandonment 30-40% (Source: Apple Pay merchant data)

### Checkout Optimization (Source: Baymard Institute)

- Inline card form (Square Web Payments SDK) converts higher than redirect (Square Checkout)
- Show security badges + "Powered by Square" near payment form
- Progress indicator for multi-step donation forms (amount → details → payment)
- Guest checkout default (never force account creation for donations)
- Show total prominently before final submit
