[text generation](/docs/guides/text-generation), [vision](/docs/guides/vision),
and [audio](/docs/guides/audio) guides.

Parameter support can differ depending on the model used to generate the

  file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for
  details.

  certain required formats for fine-tuning
  [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or
  [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.

  also has a specific required
  [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).

  you need to attach multiple uploaded files to the same vector store, use
  [`/vector_stores/{vector_store_id}/file_batches`](/docs/api-reference/vector-stores-file-batches/createBatch)
  instead of attaching them one by one. Vector store attachment has separate
  limits from file upload, including 2,000 attached files per minute per

- `createUpload` — Creates an intermediate [Upload](/docs/api-reference/uploads/object) object
that you can add [Parts](/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-object) to.
Currently, an Upload can accept at most 8 GB in total and expires after an
hour after you create it.

Once you complete the Upload, we will create a
[File](/docs/api-reference/files/object) object that contains all the parts
you uploaded. This File is usable in the rest of our platform as a regular
File object.

For certain `purpose` values, the correct `mime_type` must be specified. 
Please refer to documentation for the 
[supported MIME types for your use case](/docs/assistants/tools/file-search#supported-files).

For guidance on the proper filename extensions for each purpose, please
follow the documentation on [creating a
File](/docs/api-reference/files/create).

You can specify the order of the Parts by passing in an ordered list of the Part IDs.

The number of bytes uploaded upon completion must match the number of bytes initially specified when creating the Upload object. No Parts may be added after an Upload is completed.
Returns the Upload object with status `completed`, including an additional `file` property containing the created usable File object.

- `addUploadPart` — Adds a [Part](/docs/api-reference/uploads/part-object) to an [Upload](/docs/api-reference/uploads/object) object. A Part represents a chunk of bytes from the file you are trying to upload. 

Each Part can be at most 64 MB, and you can add Parts until you hit the Upload maximum of 8 GB.

It is possible to add multiple Parts in parallel. You can decide the intended order of the Parts when you [complete the Upload](/docs/api-reference/uploads/complete).
