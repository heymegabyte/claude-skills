# Evals

AI is foundational to many product surfaces — and like every other foundational layer, it gets first-class quality tracking. AI-heavy behavior MUST have eval cases, structured rubrics, schema-validated results, and regression tracking. Code tests prove the plumbing works; evals prove the AI layer's quality holds across model + prompt + context changes. Evals are to AI what unit tests are to logic + Lighthouse is to perf — standard quality discipline applied to a load-bearing layer.

This rule fires whenever a feature's value depends on model output: site generation, copy synthesis, classification, summarization, prompt-following, design generation. It complements skill 07 (quality-and-verification) + AI-vision QA — evals score the AI's *generation quality*, E2E scores *runtime behavior*.

## Each eval case ships ALL of these

- **Input** — the exact prompt / context / fixture fed to the AI
- **Expected behavior** — what a passing generation looks like, in plain language
- **Scoring rubric** — named dimensions, each 0-10, with what each score means
- **Automated grader** — where practical: schema check, regex, AI-judge call, axe-core, Lighthouse
- **Human-readable result** — `{ caseId, scores{}, composite, notes }` rendered for a human reviewer
- **Regression history** — every run appended to `tools/evals/results/<slug>.ndjson` for trend tracking

## Result objects are Zod-validated

- Every eval result conforms to a Zod `EvalResult` schema per ``contract-first-ai``.
- Shape: `{ caseId, slug, scores: Record<Dimension, number>, composite, verdict, notes, ranAt, model }`.
- Grader output is parsed at the boundary like every other input per `zod-everywhere` — typed contract in, typed contract out.

## Eval dimensions

- `feature_module_compliance` — does generated code match ``feature-module-architecture``?
- `type_safety` — strict TS, no `any`, typed boundaries
- `zod_validation` — Zod at every input/output per ``zod-everywhere``
- `test_coverage` — generated code ships matching tests
- `e2e_quality` — Playwright specs hermetic + homepage-first
- `design_system_compliance` — brand tokens, no hardcoded hex, ``cinematic-ui-patterns``
- `i18n_compliance` — locale mirrors per ``i18n-by-demographics``
- `accessibility` — WCAG 2.2 AA, axe 0 violations
- `performance` — LCP/CLS/INP within budget
- `observability` — Sentry breadcrumbs + structured logs present
- `security` — CSP/Trusted Types/secret hygiene, OWASP 2025
- `prompt_following` — did the output do what the prompt actually asked?

## Three-tier grading (layer cheapest-first, never one big judge)

1. **Deterministic** — schema valid? format right? under token limit? Fast, free, perfectly reliable. Run on EVERY output as a preflight before paying for any model-graded check.
2. **LLM-as-judge** — for rubric-scorable subjective cases (instruction-following, tone, conciseness). One judge call with an explicit rubric. Use g-eval (generate steps → apply → score) when the judge must inspect several dimensions; `factuality` when you have ground truth; a cheap classifier/moderation API for narrow labels (toxicity, PII, injection) instead of a general judge.
3. **Human-in-the-loop** — only where accuracy/vibes/context is paramount. Layers on top of (not instead of) the judge, and feeds corrections back.

## LLM-as-judge discipline (judges drift)

- **Calibrate against periodic human labels** — without it, judge scoring silently inflates/deflates and your eval numbers stop reflecting reality. Track judge-vs-human agreement; recalibrate on misalignment.
- Judges have biases, add latency, and can be gamed by the model under test — delimiters separate data from instructions but are NOT a security boundary.
- Use a strong judge model per `model-routing` (Opus for nuance, Haiku for binary); patterns = single-point score, pairwise compare, reference-based grade.

## Eval-driven development = TDD for AI

- Eval cases ARE the working spec. Define quality criteria BEFORE tuning a prompt or swapping a model; every change runs against them first.
- **CI ↔ prod drift is the #1 EDD failure** — when CI evals and production scoring use different definitions they diverge within months. Keep ONE eval definition driving both CI gating and online production scoring.
- Offline evals (known dataset, reproducible, code or judge scorers) gate deploys; online scoring (LLM-judge on live traces, async, no latency hit) catches prod regressions.
- Tooling: **Promptfoo** (CLI/YAML, free, built-in red-team — solo + security-conscious) or **Braintrust** (persistent dashboards, prod monitoring, lifecycle governance — teams). Pick one; don't hand-stitch eval + CI + monitoring into three drifting tools.

## Harness

- `tools/evals/` — eval cases (`<slug>.cases.ts`), graders (`graders/`), runner (`run.ts`).
- `pnpm evals` (or `npm run evals`) — runs all cases, validates results, appends to `results/<slug>.ndjson`.
- `pnpm evals --slug <name>` — single-feature run during iteration.
- Store results per-commit; surface composite-score deltas vs the prior run in CI output.
- AI-judge calls route through ``model-routing`` — Opus for nuanced quality scoring, Haiku for cheap binary checks.

### Do

- Write eval cases BEFORE tuning a prompt — watch the score move
- Use a structured rubric (named dimensions 0-10), never a vibe
- Validate every grader result with Zod — same boundary discipline as every other input
- Append every run to NDJSON so regressions are visible as a trend
- Gate CI on composite-score regression beyond a threshold (e.g. −1.5)

### Don't

- Ship an AI-heavy feature with only unit tests + no evals
- Trust a raw AI-judge response without schema validation
- Overwrite eval results — append, so regression history survives
- Conflate evals with E2E — evals = generation quality, E2E = runtime behavior
