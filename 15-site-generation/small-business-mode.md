# Small-Business Mode

When mode-inference (CLAUDE.md One-Line Prompt Mode Inference) routes a prompt to `local-business`, the build differs from `saas` and `portfolio` in priority order:

1. Conversion
2. NAP correctness
3. Trust signals
4. Owner-editable content
5. SEO
6. Polish

Owners are non-technical, so every choice optimizes for "phone calls / bookings / orders" not "GitHub stars / launch traffic."

## Trigger Phrases

Mode resolves to `local-business` when prompt contains:

- **Food** — restaurant, cafe, bakery, pizza, sushi, deli
- **Personal care** — salon, barber, spa, nails, massage, hair
- **Medical** — medical, dental, chiropractor, physio, orthodontist, dermatology, optometry, veterinarian, clinic
- **Legal** — legal, law firm, attorney, lawyer, paralegal
- **Retail** — retail, boutique, store, shop (without "online store" qualifier — that routes to `saas`)
- **Trade** — contractor, plumber, electrician, hvac, roofing, landscaping, cleaning, moving
- **Fitness** — gym, fitness, yoga, crossfit, martial arts
- **Auto** — auto, mechanic, body shop, detailing
- **Pet** — pet, grooming, kennel, training

Also fires on bare-domain prompts where `_research.json` Google Places type returns any LocalBusiness subtypes per Schema.org.

## Required Pre-Research (Phase 0a, see research-pipeline.md)

Google Places API is **non-negotiable** in this mode. Without `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (api-key-gate enforces), refuse to proceed — these are source of truth for NAP, hours, ratings, photos.

`_research.json` MUST contain:

- `business.name`
- `business.formatted_address`
- `business.formatted_phone_number`
- `business.opening_hours.weekday_text[]`
- `business.google_maps_url`
- `business.google_place_id`
- `business.coordinates{lat,lng}`
- `business.rating`
- `business.user_ratings_total`
- `business.reviews_top3[]`
- `business.photos_r2_urls[]`
- `business.primary_type`
- `business.types[]`
- `business.business_status`

Confidence ≥0.85 on every field or block the build.

**Competitor pull** (free with Places): `nearbysearch` within 5mi same-type, top 5 by rating. Used in copy ("4.8 stars vs neighborhood average 4.2 — emphasize") and pricing (if 3+ competitors publish prices, ours should too — transparency wins local SEO).

## Mandatory Page Inventory

Twelve routes minimum, per page-count gate (skill 07):

- `/` — home with primary CTA above-fold
- `/about` — owner story, years in business, credentials
- `/services` — or `/menu` for restaurants
- `/services/{slug}` — per service (pSEO — at least 4)
- `/team` — when ≥2 staff (skill 15 build-breaking-rules)
- `/pricing` — when transparency is competitive advantage
- `/contact` — form + map widget + hours block
- `/locations` — per physical address
- `/reviews` — synced from Google Places + first-party testimonials
- `/faq` — 10+ Q&A from Google Places "People also ask" + service-specific objections
- `/gallery` — Google Places photos R2-mirrored + owner uploads
- `/blog` — ONLY when `_research.json.has_existing_blog === true`

**Service detail pages** are the core pSEO play. Each one:

- H1 = `{Service} in {City}, {State}`
- 800+ words
- 1 hero photo (skill 12 image-relevance ≥8/10 to that specific service)
- 3-5 FAQs (FAQPage JSON-LD)
- Pricing range
- Before/after gallery when applicable
- "Book Now" / "Call Now" / "Get Quote" CTAs above-fold AND in body AND sticky on mobile

## NAP Authority (***NON-NEGOTIABLE***)

Name + Address + Phone must match Google Business Profile EXACTLY across every page.

- Build gate `validate-nap-consistency.mjs` (extends skill 07 — task #35) greps every dist HTML page for the canonical NAP triplet from `_research.json.business`
- Fails on any deviation (truncated address, formatted phone variations like `(555) 123-4567` vs `555-123-4567`, different suite numbers)
- One typo on `/contact` vs `/about` torpedoes local SEO ranking signals — Google penalizes inconsistent NAP across business listings

### Hyperlinks

- Every street address → `<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query={url-encoded-address}">{address}</a>` (skill 07 build-breaking-rules "Every address Google-Maps-link")
- Every phone → `<a href="tel:+1{e164-digits}">{display-format}</a>` with PostHog `phone_click` event + GA4 `generate_lead` event firing onclick
- Every email → `<a href="mailto:{email}">` with `contact_email_click` event

## Conversion Surfaces

### Above-fold primary CTA on `/`

ONE action, owner-chosen:

- **Restaurants** → "Order Online" (Toast/Square deep link) OR "Reserve a Table" (OpenTable/Resy/Tock deep link)
- **Salons** → "Book Now" (Vagaro/Square Appointments/Booksy/Cal.com)
- **Medical/dental** → "Request Appointment" (Tebra/Phreesia/Cal.com webhook)
- **Legal** → "Free Consultation" (Cal.com 30min slot)
- **Contractors** → "Get Free Quote" (form → Inngest → Resend to owner + auto-reply)

NEVER multiple equal-weight CTAs above fold — one primary + one secondary ("Call Now" `tel:` link as secondary is universal).

### Sticky mobile bottom bar (skill 10 experience)

"Call" + "Directions" + primary CTA on every page below 768px viewport.

### Skill 13 conversions tracking

`phone_click` | `direction_click` | `form_submit` | `booking_click` | `order_click` — all four into PostHog + GA4 with `value` populated where Stripe price is known.

### Map widget

Full-width Google Maps Embed on `/contact` and footer (skill 12 build-breaking-rules "Every site with physical address full-width Google Maps Embed widget").

- Iframe with `loading="lazy"` + `referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"`
- URL: `https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key={GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}&q={encoded-address}&zoom=15`

## Trust Stack (***RANK ABOVE PRETTY***)

Owners convert customers via trust, not aesthetics. Required surfaces in priority order:

1. **Google reviews** — embed top 3 on `/`, full sync on `/reviews` page, AggregateRating + Review JSON-LD per skill 15 build-breaking-rules "Every testimonials section". `validate-reviews-jsonld.mjs` (task #35) verifies count + ratings match Google Places source.
2. **Years in business** — heritage timeline on `/about` when `business.founded_year` ≥ `current_year - 5`; prominent badge "Family-owned since {year}" in header when applicable.
3. **Licenses + certifications** — visible on every service page:
   - Medical: state license #, board certification
   - Legal: bar admission, Avvo rating
   - Contractor: state license #, insurance carrier, BBB rating
4. **Local press mentions** — `_research.json.press_mentions[]` from skill 15 deep-crawl; logos row "As featured in {publication}".
5. **Photos of actual owner + actual staff + actual location** — never stock. Skill 12 image-relevance gate already enforces business-type semantic match; small-business mode adds `validate-photo-authenticity.mjs` (task #35) to block stock-looking images on team/about/gallery pages.

## Copy Voice

Sharp + irreverent voice from rules/copy-writing.md applies but DIALED DOWN for local-business — owners have repeat customers and word-of-mouth reputation; edgy copy can feel off-brand.

### Examples that work

- "We've cut hair in this town for 22 years."
- "12-minute oil changes. We know you're busy."
- "Same dentist for 15 years, same hygienist for 8. We don't have turnover problems."

### Examples that DON'T work for local

- "We disrupt traditional plumbing."
- "Revolutionary new haircut experience."

Banned by copy-writing.md anyway, but worth flagging — local owners have specifically rejected this voice in user-test.

### Microcopy on forms

Helpful + specific:

- "We'll text you the appointment confirmation within 5 minutes" beats "Submit"
- "We answer 7am-7pm. After hours, leave voicemail and we'll call back by 8:30am tomorrow" beats "Contact us anytime"

## Stripe-First Booking/Donation

When mode is `local-business` AND business takes deposits, prepayments, or upsell add-ons, default booking flow is Stripe Checkout — NOT a third-party booking platform.

**Why**: 2.9%+30¢ vs platform 5-15% take-rate, payout in 2 business days, no per-month subscription.

**Pattern**:

1. Owner books slot via Cal.com (free tier, 1 calendar)
2. Cal.com webhook → Worker creates Stripe Checkout session for deposit
3. Email magic link to customer
4. On payment success, Stripe webhook → Worker confirms booking + Inngest schedules reminder emails 24h+1h before

Skill 13 stripe webhook-first idempotent processing applies.

**For non-profits within local-business** (charity events, school fundraisers): Stripe Donation forms (Stripe-hosted, free) beat GiveDirectly/PayPal Giving. Single line of code: `<a href="https://buy.stripe.com/{donation-link-id}">Donate</a>`. Works on every device, accepts Apple Pay/Google Pay/cards/Klarna, payout direct to owner's bank.

## Owner-Editable Content

Non-technical owners need to update hours, prices, photos, FAQ without touching code. Two paths in priority order:

1. **Google Business Profile is the CMS** — Hours, primary photos, services, FAQs, posts. Owner edits in Google's UI; build pulls fresh from Places API every 6 hours via Cron Trigger; site re-renders affected pages. Owner never logs into our admin for these.
2. **Markdown files in a private R2-mirrored repo for everything else** — about story, blog posts, custom service descriptions, team bios. Owner doesn't touch repo — they email/text changes to `brian@megabyte.space`, AI commits + redeploys (10-second turnaround typical).

For owners who want self-service: scaffold a `/admin` route gated by Clerk magic-link, edit-in-place via TipTap or Editor.js (skill 06 packages list), commit via GitHub API. Don't build the admin until owner asks — most don't, and email path is faster for the 80% case.

## Performance Budget (relaxed for local)

Local-business sites typically have older customer demographics + slower mobile networks. Tighten image budgets:

- Largest hero ≤120KB (vs 200KB default)
- Total page ≤350KB (vs 500KB)
- JS ≤120KB gz (vs 200KB)

Phone+address+hours visible without JS (server-rendered in HTML shell — works on every browser including 5-year-old Android stock browsers in a service area). Lighthouse Mobile Performance ≥85 (raised from default 75).

## Local SEO Stack

### Per-route metadata (rules/per-route-metadata.md)

With location modifiers: every service-detail title includes `{Service} in {City}, {State}` — geo-relevant H1s drive 30%+ ranking gain over generic.

### Schema.org

`LocalBusiness` (or specific subtype: `Restaurant`, `Dentist`, `LegalService`, `HairSalon`, `MedicalClinic`, `AutoRepair`, `HomeAndConstructionBusiness`) with:

- `@id`
- `address` (PostalAddress)
- `geo` (GeoCoordinates)
- `openingHoursSpecification[]`
- `telephone`
- `priceRange`
- `aggregateRating` (synced Google Places rating)
- `review[]` top 5

JSON-LD validator (skill 15 `validate-jsonld-schema.mjs`) requires this on every page.

### Other files

- `humans.txt` includes owner name + nearest cross-streets (humanizing signal for E-E-A-T)
- `robots.txt` allows everything (no surface to hide)
- `sitemap.xml` `<priority>` weighted: home 1.0, services index 0.9, individual services 0.8, contact/about 0.7, blog 0.5

## Acceptance Gate (this mode only)

Build cannot ship until:

1. Google Places fields all populated at confidence ≥0.85
2. NAP consistency gate passes
3. Primary CTA functional end-to-end:
   - Form submit lands in Resend inbox
   - Booking link opens correct calendar
   - Phone `tel:` dials
4. Map widget renders (no API key error)
5. Reviews JSON-LD validates against schema.org
6. Mobile sticky CTA bar visible at 375px
7. Lighthouse Mobile ≥85
8. Source-fidelity loop passes when source domain exists
