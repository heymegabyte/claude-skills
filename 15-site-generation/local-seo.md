# Local SEO Pipeline (***MAP PACK DOMINATION***)

A gorgeous website means nothing if it doesn't rank. Local businesses live and die by Google Map Pack (top 3 local results). This submodule covers everything BEYOND the website that drives local rank.

## Google Business Profile Sync (***CRITICAL***)

Website and GBP must match EXACTLY — divergence hurts rankings. After site generation:

### Auto-sync fields

- Business name, address, phone (NAP consistency across ALL citations)
- Hours (including holiday exceptions)
- Services list
- Business description (first 750 chars = most important)
- Categories (primary + secondary)
- Attributes (wheelchair accessible, free wifi, etc.)
- Photos (upload hero + top 5 from `assets/`)

### GBP Posts

Generate 3 initial posts from site content:

1. Welcome/intro post
2. Featured service/product
3. Special offer or event

Schedule via GBP API or manual upload instructions in `_gbp_sync.json`.

### Output file

`_gbp_sync.json` — structured data matching GBP fields exactly. Worker can auto-push via Google My Business API (OAuth required) or generate human-readable instructions for manual update.

### NAP consistency check

After build, verify Name+Address+Phone match across:

- Site header, site footer
- JSON-LD
- Google Maps embed
- Contact page
- GBP listing

Any mismatch = build failure.

## Citation Building (***LOCAL RANK SIGNAL #2***)

Citations = mentions of business NAP on external directories. More consistent citations = higher local rank.

### Tier 1 — Essential (submit within 24hr of site launch)

- Google Business Profile
- Apple Maps Connect
- Bing Places

- **Legal** — Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, Martindale-Hubbell, Lawyers.com
- **Restaurant** — TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Grubhub, DoorDash, Zomato
- **Salon/Spa** — StyleSeat, Booksy, Vagaro, SalonCentric

### Tier 3 — General Directories (submit within 2 weeks)

- CitySearch, Local.com, MerchantCircle, Brownbook, eLocal

### Output file

`_citations.json` — list of directories with: name, URL, submission status (pending/submitted/verified), NAP data to submit, category. Worker tracks submission status in D1.

### Automation

- For directories with APIs (Yelp, Foursquare, Apple Maps): auto-submit via Worker
- For manual-only directories: generate step-by-step instructions with pre-filled data in `_citation_instructions.md`

## Review Generation (***LOCAL RANK SIGNAL #1***)

Review velocity (new reviews per month) is the single biggest Map Pack ranking signal. Not fake reviews — systematic request workflow.

### QR-to-Review Flow

Generate `assets/review-qr.svg` — QR code linking to: `https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid={PLACE_ID}`. Display on:

- Thank-you page
- Email footer
- Printable card (PDF in `assets/`)

### Review Request Page

Build `/review` page on generated site:

- "How was your experience?" → 5-star rating
- If **≥4 stars**: redirect to Google review page
- If **<3 stars**: show feedback form (captures complaint privately, prevents negative public review)

### Post-Visit Automation (instructions for business owner)

Generate `_review_automation.md` with setup instructions for:

- **Email** — Resend template triggered 24hr after appointment/purchase. Subject: "How was your visit to `{business_name}`?" CTA: "Leave a Review →" linking to Google review URL.
- **SMS** — Twilio template (if phone collected). Same timing, shorter copy.
- **In-store** — Printable QR card design (PDF) for counter/receipt stapling.

### Review Widget on Site

- Pull Google Places reviews → display on site with: star rating, reviewer name, date, text (truncated with "Read more" linking to Google)
- Carousel on mobile
- Min 3 reviews displayed
- If <3 reviews available: show testimonial section instead with CTA to leave first review

## Trust Badge Verification (***CONVERSION SIGNAL***)

Don't just list certifications — verify and display them with badge images.

### Auto-Discovery Pipeline

From research data, identify claimed certifications. Attempt verification:

- **BBB Rating** — BBB API or scrape → BBB badge with rating letter
- **Chamber of Commerce** — Local chamber website scrape → Member badge with year
- **Google Guaranteed** — Google LSA API → Green checkmark badge
- **ASE Certified** (auto) — ASE website → Blue seal with specialties
- **HIPAA Compliant** (medical) — Self-declared, standard badge → HIPAA badge in footer
- **ADA Compliant** — Self-declared after axe-core pass → ADA badge in footer
- **Licensed & Insured** — State license board scrape → License # in footer
- **SOC2/GDPR** (SaaS) — Self-declared → Badge in footer + trust section
- **Angi/HomeAdvisor** (construction) — Angi API or scrape → Rating badge
- **ABMP** (massage) — ABMP directory → Member badge

### Badge image generation

If no official badge image available, generate clean SVG badge with Ideogram: `{Certification Name}` + icon + year. Store in `assets/badges/`.

### Display pattern

- Trust badges section after hero or in sidebar
- Footer row of badge images
- Service pages show relevant certifications inline

## Local Conversion Tracking (***MEASURE WHAT MATTERS***)

SaaS conversions (trial-to-paid) are irrelevant for local businesses. Track these instead:

### Event Taxonomy (PostHog + GA4)

- `phone_click` — `tel:` link clicked (**primary conversion**)
- `direction_click` — Google Maps directions clicked
- `form_submit` — contact/booking form submitted
- `booking_click` — external booking system CTA clicked
- `email_click` — `mailto:` link clicked
- `chat_open` — live chat widget opened
- `review_click` — review CTA clicked
- `menu_download` — PDF menu downloaded (restaurant)
- `coupon_claim` — special offer/coupon clicked
- `social_click` — social media profile link clicked

### GA4 Goals (auto-configure via GTM)

1. **Phone Call** — `phone_click` event
2. **Direction Request** — `direction_click` event
3. **Form Submission** — `form_submit` event
4. **Booking** — `booking_click` event

### Call Tracking (optional, premium)

If business opts in:

- **Google forwarding number** via Google Ads (free with ads account)
- **CallRail** integration ($45/mo)

Tracks: call duration, caller location, call recording, missed call alerts. Without call tracking: count `tel:` clicks as proxy.

### Local Funnel

Visit → Page View → Engagement (scroll 50%+) → Micro-conversion (menu view, gallery browse) → Macro-conversion (call, directions, form, booking)

PostHog funnel: define per-site, track weekly conversion rate. Alert if rate drops >20% week-over-week.

## Local Schema Enhancements

Beyond basic JSON-LD, add:

- **`geo` coordinates** — lat/lng from Google Places (Map Pack signal)
- **`areaServed`** — list of cities/neighborhoods served
- **`priceRange`** — "$" to "$$$$" from research
- **`aggregateRating`** — from Google Places reviews
- **`hasMenu`** — for restaurants (MenuSection+MenuItem)
- **`openingHoursSpecification`** — day-by-day including exceptions
- **`paymentAccepted`** — Cash, Credit Card, etc.
- **`currenciesAccepted`** — USD
- **`sameAs`** — all verified social profiles
- **`knowsAbout`** — services/specialties list

## Integration Points

- `research-pipeline.md` → provides Place ID, reviews, hours, geo for GBP sync
- `media-acquisition.md` → badge images generated alongside other assets
- `build-prompts.md` → review widget + trust badges injected into build
- `quality-gates.md` → NAP consistency check added to quality scoring
- `domain-features.md` → conversion events match feature CTAs
- `13-observability-and-growth` → local conversion events fire alongside SaaS events
