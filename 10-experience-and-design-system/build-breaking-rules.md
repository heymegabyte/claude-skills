# 10 — Build-Breaking Experience + Design Rules

Migrated from `~/.claude/rules/always.md` 2026-05-03.

## Every clickable card/tile (***UNIVERSAL — supersedes "tile-as-link" partial***)

Every card/tile (publication, person, service, project, product, blog) that ENTIRELY links to ONE deep target MUST:

- (a) Wrap the entire surface in `<a href>` (or `role="link" tabindex=0` with onClick)
- (b) `cursor: pointer` on the whole tile (NOT just inner button)
- (c) Hover lift `transform: translateY(-3px)` + accent border glow
- (d) Inner clickable elements (View button, org name, image) ALL point to the SAME deep target — never internal stub

Validator (`validate-card-deeplinks.mjs`): every `[data-card]` element has matching `href` AND `cursor: pointer` computed-style at 6bp.

## Every detail-card (publication | paper | case-study | person | portfolio item)

MUST enrich with deep-link to canonical authoritative source — DOI/PubMed/arXiv/journal article URL/external authority page (NEVER internal route stub when external source exists). Card body MUST hyperlink the institution/journal/conference/org name to its canonical URL using the institution name as anchor text. Visible action buttons (View, Read Full Paper, Download, Open) MUST point to the deeplink — never to an internal `/portfolio/slug` page that just re-displays the card.

Build gate: research pipeline annotates each card item with `deeplink_url` in `_research.json`; missing deeplink for items typed `publication|paper|case-study` = fail.

## Every multi-image section (***ONE LIGHTBOX GROUP + INTEGRATED CAPTIONS — UNIVERSAL***)

When a section/page contains ≥2 lightbox-eligible images on the SAME topic (gallery, services, team, portfolio, blog hero set, before/after, location grid), ALL images MUST share ONE `data-gallery="<section-slug>"` ID — never split same-section images across multiple lightbox groups.

Captions: every image carries a meaningful caption (title + 1-line description + optional credit) shipped IN BOTH:

- The section UI (visible card overlay or below-image figcaption)
- The lightbox modal (visible bottom strip + screen-reader announcement via `aria-describedby`)

Caption shape: `{ title: string, description: string, credit?: string, link?: string }`.

Validator (`validate-lightbox-grouping.mjs`): detects `[data-gallery]` IDs per route — if section has ≥2 images and ≥2 distinct gallery IDs in same `<section>` ancestor = fail. Caption presence gate: every `[data-zoomable]` MUST have a `data-caption-title` AND `data-caption-description` attribute = fail otherwise.

## Every interactive feature (***FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATOR — NOT JUST STYLING — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every interactive UI element (filter chip, tab, accordion, search input, sort dropdown, toggle, modal, lightbox, mega-menu, infinite-scroll trigger, pagination link, "Load more" button) MUST functionally do the thing its label promises — never render as styled-but-stub UI.

- Filter chip "All Posts | News | Events | Updates" MUST actually filter the post grid when clicked (DOM diff before vs after click asserts `[data-post-card]` count changes OR `[hidden]` attributes toggle OR URL hash updates)
- Tab "Overview | Pricing | Reviews" MUST swap visible panel content
- Search input MUST filter results live or on submit
- Sort dropdown MUST reorder children

Validator (`validate-interactive-functionality.mjs`): Playwright finds every `[data-filter], [role=tab], [aria-controls], [data-search], [data-sort], [data-load-more]` element, simulates click/input, snapshots DOM before+after, asserts measurable difference (count change, attribute toggle, content swap, URL hash update); FAIL on any element where `state-after === state-before`.

## Every blog/news/portfolio listing (***FUNCTIONAL TAXONOMY FILTERS + SEARCH + SORT + URL-SYNC — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Supersedes "Every interactive feature" for blog-specific surfaces.

Every page that lists ≥2 posts/articles/case-studies/projects/products MUST ship working category filter + tag filter + free-text search + sort-by-date AND each filter MUST be wired to real corpus data, NOT decorative.

### Required behaviors

1. **Category click** — filters `[data-post-card]` to that category only AND updates URL `?category=<slug>` AND updates `aria-pressed=true` on active chip AND updates "Showing N of M posts" counter AND deep-link-on-load reads `?category=<slug>` and pre-applies filter
2. **Tag click** — same as category but with `?tag=<slug>` (multi-tag = comma-separated)
3. **Free-text `[data-search]` input** — filters by title + excerpt + tags (case-insensitive substring) within 150ms debounce, updates URL `?q=<term>`
4. **Sort dropdown** — reorders by `data-published-at` (newest | oldest | popular when popularity tracked)
5. **Empty-state when filter yields 0 results** — friendly message + "Clear filters" CTA that strips URL params + refreshes listing
6. **`<select>` and chip implementations** — both work with keyboard (Tab/Enter/Space/Esc) AND screen-reader (aria-controls, aria-expanded, role=listbox/option)

Implementation MUST be client-side state (signals/useState) reading from a single `posts: Post[]` array — NEVER server round-trip per filter (slow + breaks SPA navigation). Categories + tags rendered MUST be the actual unique values from `posts.flatMap(p => p.categories)` deduped — NEVER hand-authored chip lists that drift from corpus.

Validator (`validate-blog-filters.mjs`): for every route matching `/blog|/news|/articles|/posts|/press|/portfolio|/projects|/case-studies|/insights|/stories`, Playwright:

- (a) Counts posts before filter
- (b) Clicks each category chip in turn
- (c) Asserts post count after click is `<` initial count AND `>` 0 (assuming ≥2 categories exist)
- (d) Asserts URL contains `?category=<slug>`
- (e) Clicks "All" chip, asserts post count returns to initial
- (f) Types in search box, asserts post count drops
- (g) Reload page with `?category=<slug>` in URL, asserts pre-applied filter state matches

FAIL any step where state-after === state-before OR URL doesn't sync OR pre-applied filter ignores query string.

## Every filter-chip

- **Inactive state** — outline + accent text on transparent bg
- **Active/selected state** — **INVERTED** (filled accent bg, bg-color text — fg/bg swap), NEVER a different accent color

Pattern:

```css
.chip { color: var(--brand-accent); border: 1px solid var(--brand-accent); background: transparent }
.chip[aria-pressed="true"], .chip.is-active { color: var(--bg-primary); background: var(--brand-accent); border-color: var(--brand-accent) }
```

Selected state must visually FILL — not just shift color.

## Every mega-menu / multi-column nav (***HOVER-BRIDGE + TRIANGLE-AIM ALGORITHM — UNIVERSAL — desktop hover-driven nav***)

Every desktop nav with multi-column dropdown/mega-menu MUST implement hover-bridge + triangle-aim algorithm so menu does NOT close when cursor crosses the gap from trigger to panel.

- **Hover-bridge** — invisible `::before` element on dropdown panel, `position:absolute; top:-12px; left:0; right:0; height:12px` (matches gap to trigger) — fills the cursor-traversal corridor
- **Triangle-aim (Bostock 2013)** — JS tracks last 3 mousemove positions, computes vector toward bottom-edge of panel; if cursor moves INTO the triangle defined by current cursor + bottom-left + bottom-right of panel, delay close 300ms; if cursor moves OUTSIDE triangle, close 150ms
- **Open-delay** — 100ms (intent)
- **Close-delay** — 300ms-when-aimed-at-panel / 150ms-when-aimed-away
- **Touch (`pointer:coarse`)** — tap-to-open + tap-outside-to-close, NO hover bridge
- **Keyboard** — Enter/Space opens, Esc closes, Arrow keys navigate items, Tab moves to next trigger

Validator (`validate-mega-menu-hover.mjs`): Playwright desktop run hovers trigger → moves cursor diagonally toward panel through gap → asserts panel still open after 250ms; second run moves cursor away → asserts close within 200ms. Template ships `<MegaMenu>` component implementing both — never hand-rolled per site.

## Every clickable element (***POINTER-CURSOR HONESTY — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

`cursor: pointer` MUST appear on AND ONLY ON elements that actually do something on click. Hovering a non-clickable element with the pointer cursor = lying to the user about interactivity.

### Forbidden

- Decorative cards with `cursor: pointer` but no onclick/href
- Stat-counter blocks with pointer cursor
- Hero illustrations with pointer cursor
- Plain `<p>`/`<div>` text blocks with pointer cursor inherited from a parent

### Required

- Every `<a href>` / `<button>` / `<role=button>` / element with attached onClick handler GETS `cursor: pointer`
- Every element WITHOUT click behavior gets `cursor: default` (or unset, inheriting body default)

### Edge cases

- Text input/textarea/select — use `cursor: text`/`cursor: pointer` natively; don't override
- Drag handles — `cursor: grab` → `cursor: grabbing`

Validator (`validate-pointer-cursor-honesty.mjs`): Playwright at 6bp samples computed `cursor` property of every element; for each element with `cursor: pointer`, assert it has `[onclick]` OR `<a href>` ancestor OR `<button>` ancestor OR `[role=button]` OR `[role=link]` OR `[role=tab]` OR `[role=menuitem]` ancestor — FAIL on bare `<p>`/`<div>`/`<span>`/`<section>` with pointer cursor and no click handler.

## Every lightbox close (***SCROLL-POSITION PRESERVATION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every multi-image section"***)

When lightbox modal closes (Esc key, X button, backdrop click, swipe-down on touch), the underlying page scroll position MUST snap back to the EXACT scrollY where the user was when they opened the lightbox — never reset to 0, never jump to top, never lose the scroll context.

### Implementation

- **On lightbox open** — capture `const restoreY = window.scrollY` AND apply `document.body.style.cssText = 'position: fixed; top: -' + restoreY + 'px; left: 0; right: 0; overflow-y: scroll'` (the `overflow-y: scroll` prevents scrollbar layout shift on platforms with persistent scrollbars)
- **On close** — `document.body.style.cssText = ''` THEN `window.scrollTo({ top: restoreY, behavior: 'instant' })` — instant, NOT smooth (smooth feels broken when returning from a modal)

Same pattern applies to ANY full-screen modal (mobile menu, command palette, video player).

Validator (`validate-modal-scroll-preservation.mjs`): Playwright opens lightbox/modal at `scrollY=2000`, closes via Esc, asserts `window.scrollY === 2000` within 50ms.

## Every expandable card / "Read More" toggle (***NO CONTENT CROPPING — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Cards/blocks with collapsed-by-default text + "More details" / "Read more" / "Show full" / "Expand" toggle MUST render the FULL expanded content visibly within the card's expanded box — never crop, never truncate after expand, never require the user to scroll within the card.

### Implementation

- **Collapsed state** — `max-height: <N>px; overflow: hidden; mask-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #000 70%, transparent 100%)` (fade-out mask makes the truncation feel intentional)
- **Expanded state** — `max-height: none; overflow: visible; mask-image: none` — let the card grow to fit
- **NEVER** — expanded state with `max-height: 600px; overflow-y: scroll` (creates double-scroll UX, content hidden behind inner scrollbar)
- **Animation** — transition `max-height` from collapsed value to a calculated `scrollHeight + 'px'` then to `none` post-animation (CSS can't transition to/from `none`, JS sets it after `transitionend`)

Validator (`validate-expandable-card-no-crop.mjs`): Playwright clicks every `[data-expandable]` toggle, samples post-expand `getBoundingClientRect().height` vs `scrollHeight` — if `clientHeight < scrollHeight` after expand, content is cropped = fail.

## Every search input (***MIN VISIBLE WIDTH ≥50ch DESKTOP — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every interactive feature"***)

Every `<input type="search">` / `<input data-search>` MUST render at minimum 50 visible characters (`min-width: clamp(20rem, 60vw, 40rem)`) on viewports ≥768px. On viewports <768px the search input MUST stack to full width (`width: 100%`) below adjacent filter chips/sort controls — never crammed into a 200px sliver beside chips.

### Pattern

- Filter chips in a flex-wrap container with `gap: 0.5rem`
- Search input as a separate row with `width: clamp(20rem, 100%, 40rem)` and `font-size: 1rem` (≥16px on iOS to prevent input zoom)
- Search results dropdown/inline-filter MUST be at least as wide as the input

Validator (`validate-search-input-width.mjs`): Playwright at 1280px samples `[type=search], [data-search]` input bounding-rect width — fail if `<320px`; at 375px sample width — fail if input shares row with chips.

## Every full-width visual section (***FULL-VIEWPORT BREAKOUT FOR HERO/MEDIA — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Site shells MUST distinguish between text-content sections (constrained `max-width: 65ch / 1100px / clamp(min, content, 1280px)` with side gutters) and visual-impact sections (hero, image gallery, full-bleed video, immersive section dividers, comparison-table, data-grid) which MUST break out to full viewport width (`100vw`, edge-to-edge, no side gutters, ignoring parent container padding).

### Implementation

- Outer `<main>` has `padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem)`
- Full-bleed sections use `margin-inline: calc(50% - 50vw); padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem)` to escape parent gutters and re-apply as inner padding — content stays readable but section bg/imagery extends to viewport edges
- **Hero images** — full-bleed by default
- **Galleries with ≥6 images** — full-bleed grid
- **Wide data-tables / comparison matrices** — full-bleed when content needs >1100px to render
- **Text paragraphs / blog body** — stay constrained at 65ch — full-bleed text destroys readability

Validator (`validate-full-bleed-sections.mjs`): for every page, snapshot section bounding-rect widths — fail if hero `<section>` width < `100vw` (allowing 1px scrollbar tolerance), fail if `<table data-comparison>` overflows its container instead of breaking out, fail if `<p>` text-block exceeds 75ch (over-wide reading line).

## Every vertical-stack interactive section (***LEVERAGE FULL SCREEN REAL-ESTATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every full-width visual section"***)

When a page section renders content that STACKS VERTICALLY (timelines with alternating left/right cards, dossier/spotlight components, multi-card grids of ≥6 items, stat-roll-up bars, partner-logo strips, pastor/team grids, founding-facts dl grids, photo galleries ≥4 items, comparison tables, FAQ accordions ≥6 entries, leadership/board grids) the OUTER container MUST be `max-w-6xl` / `max-w-7xl` / full-bleed — NEVER `max-w-3xl` / `max-w-prose` / `max-w-4xl`.

Narrow `max-w-3xl` is reserved EXCLUSIVELY for body prose (≤65ch reading line). Anything that's a structured/interactive surface — even on an otherwise prose-heavy page — MUST break out of the prose container.

### Rationale

- Alternating-card timelines squeezed into a 768px container render as a single column on desktop (defeating the design)
- Pastor grids in `max-w-3xl` show 2 columns max instead of 4
- Founding-facts dl shows tiny stat cards
- Mobile-responsive constraint preserved via standard 1-col stack at `<768px` — widening the desktop container does NOT break mobile

### Pattern

Structure About/Services/History-style pages as sibling `<section>` elements each with their own `max-w-*` based on content type:

- Prose `<section className="max-w-3xl">`
- Structured `<section className="max-w-7xl">`
- Immersive media `<section>` full-bleed

Do NOT wrap all content in a single `max-w-3xl` and then nest everything inside it. Component-level heading + intro paragraph inside a `max-w-7xl` section may use an inner `<div className="max-w-3xl">` for the heading copy specifically — the interactive surface below it spans the full container.

Validator (`validate-vertical-stack-width.mjs`): Playwright at 1280px finds `[data-timeline], [data-stat-rollup], [data-partner-strip], [data-pastor-grid], ol.grid, dl.grid, [data-dossier], details.accordion` — assert each parent `<section>` `width >= 1024px` (i.e. not constrained by `max-w-3xl ≈ 768px` or `max-w-4xl ≈ 896px`). Fail code: `vertical-stack.constrained-by-prose-container`.

## Every site at every viewport (***FULL-SCREEN REAL-ESTATE UTILIZATION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — supersedes hard pixel `max-width` shells***)

Every generated site at every viewport from 320px through 3840px MUST consume the available screen real-estate — never leave dead margins on ultrawide, never trap cinematic content in narrow prose columns, never crash to a single 600px column on a 1024px tablet.

### Implementation

- Outer container token scales fluidly `--container: min(1680px, calc(100vw - clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem)))`
- Ultrawide bumps:
  - `@media (min-width: 1920px) { --container: min(1820px, calc(100vw - 4rem)); }`
  - `@media (min-width: 2400px) { --container: min(2000px, calc(100vw - 6rem)); }`
- Inner section constraints (`.timeline { max-width }`, `.gallery-grid { max-width }`, `.team-grid { max-width }`, panel/manifesto/feature frames) MUST scale with the outer container — fixed caps like `max-width: 960px` on a timeline waste ~720px of canvas on a 1920px display
- **Mobile** — container = `100vw - clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem)` so content uses 90%+ of small screens, never crammed at 600px on a 768px tablet, never overflowing horizontally on a 360px phone
- Every section: structured/interactive surfaces (timeline, dossier, stat-rollup, gallery, team grid, comparison table, partner strip, FAQ accordion, content cards) USE FULL CONTAINER WIDTH; only true reading prose stays constrained at `≤78ch`

### Forbidden patterns

- Hard pixel `max-width: 1120px` on shells when viewport is 2560px (loses 1440px to dead space)
- Hard `max-width: 640px` on prose blocks within sections meant to feel cinematic
- `max-width: 960px` on timelines when outer container is already widened
- `width: 100%` on a section but inner `<div class="content">` re-imposes a narrower cap
- Static `padding-inline: 4rem` instead of `clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem)` (over-pads phones, under-pads ultrawides)
- Viewport units without `svh/dvh` fallback for mobile chrome

### Required pattern

Every shell/panel/section uses fluid `min(<cinema-cap>, <viewport-pct>)` so it expands toward the cap on big screens, contracts gracefully on small.

Validator (`validate-real-estate-usage.mjs`): Playwright at 6 breakpoints (375, 768, 1280, 1680, 1920, 2560) screenshots every `<section>`, samples widest content block bounding-rect width vs viewport width — fail if at 1920px+ the widest content block uses <80% of viewport (excluding intentional reading-prose containers tagged `[data-prose]` or `<article class="prose">` which may stay ≤78ch) OR if at 375px any block overflows viewport horizontally (`scrollWidth > clientWidth`) OR if at 1280px the canvas-utilization ratio across ALL non-prose sections averages <75%.

Fail codes:

- `real-estate.dead-margin-ultrawide`
- `real-estate.cramped-mobile`
- `real-estate.fixed-pixel-shell`
- `real-estate.inner-cap-overrides-container`

## Every gallery image / carousel image (***LIGHTBOX MUST OPEN ON CLICK — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every multi-image section"***)

Every `<img>` element that renders inside a `[data-gallery]` container, `[class*="carousel"]`, `[class*="slider"]`, `[class*="gallery"]`, `.swiper-slide`, `.splide__slide`, `.glide__slide`, or any multi-image grid section MUST open a fullscreen lightbox modal when clicked — no exceptions.

### Lightbox must

- (a) Render within 300ms of click
- (b) Show the full-resolution image (not the thumbnail)
- (c) Display the caption from `data-caption-title` + `data-caption-description`
- (d) Support keyboard navigation (←/→ arrows cycle images, Esc closes)
- (e) Trap focus inside modal while open (WCAG 2.4.3)
- (f) Restore scroll position on close (per existing scroll-preservation rule)
- (g) Announce via `role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-label="Image lightbox"`

Images NOT in a gallery context (inline editorial photos, single hero, logo, icon, avatar <200px) MUST NOT open lightbox on click — pointer cursor honesty (they're not clickable).

Lightbox eligibility: `kind != logo AND dims >= 200×200 AND inside multi-image parent`.

### Implementation

Template ships `src/lib/lightbox.ts` — MUST use BOTH DOMContentLoaded AND `MutationObserver` to wire all `[data-gallery] img` elements because React renders images ASYNCHRONOUSLY after DOMContentLoaded fires (root cause of first-image-only bug confirmed 2026-05-06).

```js
const wire = (img) => { if(!img.dataset.lightboxWired){ img.addEventListener('click',openLightbox); img.dataset.lightboxWired='1'; } };
document.querySelectorAll('[data-gallery] img').forEach(wire);
new MutationObserver(muts => muts.flatMap(m=>[...m.addedNodes]).filter(n=>n.nodeType===1).forEach(n=>{
  [...n.querySelectorAll('[data-gallery] img'), ...(n.matches('[data-gallery] img')?[n]:[])].forEach(wire);
})).observe(document.body,{subtree:true,childList:true})
```

Every `<img>` inside `[data-gallery]` in the static HTML output MUST have `data-zoomable data-caption-title="..." data-caption-description="..."` attributes — NOT added via JS after render. Lazy-loads full-res from `data-full-src` attr (thumbnail in `src`, full-res in `data-full-src`).

### NEVER

- Clicking a gallery image navigates to a new page instead of opening lightbox
- Clicking opens lightbox but it's empty/broken
- Clicking does nothing
- Only the FIRST image opens lightbox (all must)

Validator (`validate-lightbox-opens-on-click.mjs`): Playwright on every route, finds ALL `[data-gallery] img` (not just first), clicks each, asserts `[role="dialog"]` appears within 500ms. Build validator `build_validators.ts validateLightboxPresence` now checks ≥2 HTML img elements have `data-zoomable` attribute (not just JS bundle string) — fail code `lightbox.html_wiring_incomplete`.

Fail codes: `lightbox.not_opened` | `lightbox.empty_modal` | `lightbox.html_wiring_incomplete`.

## Every site nav/header (***SOLID BACKGROUND — NEVER TRANSPARENT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Nav/header MUST have a solid, opaque background at ALL times — including on the homepage hero, on hero-scroll overlap, on mobile drawer open, on any route. Transparent or `background: none` headers let hero content bleed through the nav, making nav items illegible and the page look unfinished.

**Allowed exception** — hero-parallax scroll effect where header transitions from transparent TO solid at ≤50px scroll (but must be SOLID by 50px — never stays transparent).

Implementation: nav base CSS `background-color: var(--nav-bg, var(--bg-primary)); backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` — blur adds depth but NEVER replaces a solid base. If hero uses full-bleed image behind nav area, nav must have an explicit solid band (NOT a gradient that fades to transparent).

Build gate: Playwright screenshots nav at scrollY=0 on every route — samples computed `background-color` at nav centroid — any `rgba(* * * / 0)` or `transparent` = fail. Nav text/logo must contrast nav bg by ≥4.5:1 at 6bp. Sticky nav must maintain solid bg on scroll — never `position:sticky` with `background: transparent`.

## Every site nav/header (***Z-INDEX STACK + CLIP PREVENTION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Nav MUST have `z-index: ≥100` and MUST NOT be clipped by hero sections, sliders (Swiper/Splide/Glide), or `overflow: hidden` parent wrappers.

Pattern: if any hero/slider sets its own stacking context (`transform`, `will-change`, `filter`, `isolation`), the nav MUST live OUTSIDE that stacking context in the DOM.

Validator: at 6bp, Playwright samples nav `getBoundingClientRect().top` — assert nav is always visible (top ≥ 0) AND that nav element is NOT contained inside any element with `overflow:hidden`.

## Every section (***VISUAL DISTINCTION — ALTERNATING TREATMENT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Adjacent sections MUST have visually distinct treatment so users can perceive section boundaries.

### Allowed alternation strategies (pick ≥1 per section boundary)

- (a) Alternate bg: `var(--bg-primary)` / `var(--bg-secondary)` / accent-tinted band
- (b) Geometric shape divider (wave, diagonal, angled clip-path) between sections
- (c) Explicit `border-top 1px solid var(--border-subtle)`
- (d) Increased vertical padding creating visual breathing room

**NEVER** — two consecutive sections with identical `background-color` AND no divider AND touching vertical padding (they merge into one undifferentiated blob).

Validator: for each pair of sibling `<section>` elements, compute their computed bg colors — if identical AND no `::before/::after` divider element AND no border-top — fail.

## Every card grid (***UNIFORM IMAGE PRESENCE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

In any card/tile grid, ALL cards MUST have images or NONE do. Mixed grids (some cards with a hero image, others with empty/placeholder bg) look broken and inconsistent.

When generating cards:

- If ≥50% of items in the corpus have images, ALL cards get images (augment missing ones via GPT Image 1.5 per-slot prompt)
- If <50% of items have images, render ALL cards without images (use icon/number/initial avatar as uniform accent)

Validator (`validate-card-image-uniformity.mjs`): for each `[data-card-grid]`, compute `cards_with_img / total_cards` — if `> 0` and `< 1.0` = fail (must be all-or-nothing).

## Every lightbox (***CSS BACKGROUND-IMAGE EXCLUDED — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every gallery image"***)

CSS `background-image: url(...)` properties are NEVER lightbox-eligible regardless of size, quality, or context. Only `<img src>` and `<picture><source>` elements are lightbox-eligible.

### Reasons

- CSS bg images have no natural alt text
- No semantic meaning
- Decorative by definition
- Clicking a CSS bg element clicks the overlay text on top — not the image itself

Implementation: lightbox auto-wiring script MUST query `[data-gallery] img` (HTMLImageElement only) — NEVER walk `getComputedStyle(el).backgroundImage` from section elements.

Validator: assert no `[data-gallery]` section has a lightbox click listener attached to a non-`<img>` DOM element.

## Every anchor-wrapped image (***LINK NAVIGATION WINS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every gallery image"***)

Any `<img>` whose nearest ancestor is `<a href="...">` (blog/news/portfolio listing thumbnails, card hero images, "read more" tile previews, related-post tiles) MUST navigate to the link target on click — NEVER open a lightbox. Anchor + img = navigation, full stop.

Lightbox handlers MUST early-return on `img.closest('a[href]')` and skip cursor:zoom-in marking. The ONLY exception: the anchor itself carries `data-lightbox` or `data-gallery` (explicit opt-in for "linked-image-also-zooms" UX, very rare). Cursor: linked images use `cursor: pointer` (default for anchors), not `zoom-in`.

### Lightbox eligibility check order

1. Reject in header/footer/data-no-zoom/button
2. Accept if explicit `[data-lightbox]/[data-gallery]` opt-in
3. Reject if inside `a[href]`
4. Accept if dims ≥80×80

Validator (`validate-anchor-image-no-lightbox.mjs`): Playwright finds every `a[href] img` on `/blog`, `/news`, `/portfolio`, listing pages — clicks each, asserts URL changes (navigation) AND no `[role="dialog"]` opens within 300ms.

Fail code: `lightbox.intercepts_link_navigation`.

## Every photo/image (***GROUPING LABEL + SECTION SLUG — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every multi-image section"***)

Every `data-gallery` attribute MUST have a companion `data-gallery-label` attribute describing the photo set in 2-5 words:

```html
data-gallery="team-photos" data-gallery-label="Leadership Team"
```

The label renders in the lightbox modal header AND as an `aria-label` on the `<figure>` wrapping element.

Validator: every `[data-gallery]` element in dist/ HTML must have a non-empty `data-gallery-label` attribute AND every `img[data-zoomable]` in same section must share the section-slug as its `data-gallery` value.

Section-slug derivation: `kebabCase(section.dataset.section || section.id || h2/h3.textContent.trim().slice(0,30))`.

## Every image element (***DESCRIPTIVE ALT TEXT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every `<img>` must have an `alt` attribute that:

- (a) Is non-empty
- (b) Does NOT equal `"image"`, `"photo"`, `"picture"`, `"img"`, or the filename
- (c) Describes the SUBJECT matter in 5-15 words

Decorative images (pure CSS decoration that conveys no information) use `alt=""` (empty string intentionally — signals to screen readers to skip).

Validator: grep dist/ HTML for `alt=""` on non-decorative images (any img inside `[data-gallery]`, article, `section:not([data-decorative])`) = fail; grep for `alt="image"` or `alt="photo"` = fail.

Per-slot GPT Image 1.5 prompt must include `alt_text` in the JSON response schema — auto-applied to the generated img tag.

## Every comparison table / data grid (***FULL-BLEED LAYOUT WHEN >1100px CONTENT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every full-width visual section"***)

Comparison tables (pricing tiers, feature matrices, paperboard-substrate specs, product-spec tables) and data grids with ≥4 columns OR ≥1100px natural content width MUST render full-bleed (per "Every full-width visual section" rule) AND MUST NOT use `overflow-x: scroll` to hide right columns on desktop.

**Mobile (≤768px) reflow pattern** — stack table as cards, each card showing one row with column headers as labels (`<dl>` per row OR CSS `display: contents` + grid with `grid-template-areas`).

Validator (`validate-comparison-table-fullbleed.mjs`): for every `<table data-comparison>` AND every `[data-grid][data-cols≥4]`:

- At 1280px assert table renders full-bleed (width ≥ container 100vw - allowable scrollbar) AND no right column is clipped (rightmost cell `right` ≤ viewport width)
- At 375px assert table reflows to stacked cards (no horizontal scroll)

## Every page depth > 1 (***BREADCRUMBS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every route whose URL depth is ≥2 (e.g. `/blog/post-slug`, `/team/jane-doe`, `/services/consulting`) MUST render a visible breadcrumb nav immediately below the page header / above the page H1 — never inside the hero, never inside the footer.

```html
<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <ol itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList">…</ol>
</nav>
```

Each breadcrumb item:

```html
<li itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
  <a itemprop="item" href="/"><span itemprop="name">Home</span></a>
  <meta itemprop="position" content="1"/>
</li>
```

Final item is `<span itemprop="name">Current Page</span>` (NOT a link — current location is not clickable).

Visual separators rendered via CSS `::after { content: "/" }` NOT embedded in HTML (screen readers skip separators via CSS). Breadcrumb JSON-LD `BreadcrumbList` on same page MUST match the visible breadcrumb exactly (same items, same order, same names).

Validator (`validate-breadcrumbs.mjs`): for every route with URL depth ≥2, assert `nav[aria-label="Breadcrumb"]` present + `[itemtype*="BreadcrumbList"]` in head JSON-LD.

## Every site (***SKIP-TO-CONTENT FIRST FOCUSABLE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — WCAG 2.4.1***)

The FIRST focusable element in every HTML page MUST be:

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
```

(or the locale-equivalent).

### CSS pattern

```css
.skip-link { position: absolute; top: -60px; left: 0; z-index: 10000; background: var(--brand-accent); color: var(--bg-primary); padding: .5rem 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; border-radius: 0 0 4px 0; transition: top .15s ease }
.skip-link:focus { top: 0 }
```

Visible only on keyboard focus (Tab), invisible at rest. The target `<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">` MUST exist on every page; the `tabindex="-1"` allows focus to land on main without showing outline. Every sub-page and every SPA route change MUST re-move focus to the h1 (or `<main>`) after navigation — never leave focus stranded in the old route's DOM node.

Validator (`validate-skip-link.mjs`): Playwright tabs to first focusable element, asserts `classList.contains("skip-link")` AND element visible on focus AND `href` resolves to `#main-content` AND `#main-content` element exists.

Fail codes: `a11y.skip_link_missing` | `a11y.skip_link_not_first` | `a11y.skip_target_missing`.

## Every site (***BACK-TO-TOP BUTTON — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site with any page whose scrollable content exceeds two viewports MUST include a back-to-top button:

```html
<button class="back-to-top" aria-label="Back to top">↑</button>
```

Rendered `position: fixed; bottom: 1.5rem; right: 1.5rem; z-index: 500`.

### Behavior

- Hidden at `scrollY === 0`
- Appears with `opacity: 0→1; transform: translateY(8px)→translateY(0)` 200ms ease when `scrollY > 300`
- Click scrolls to top via `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })`
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — instant scroll, no animation on appearance
- **Size** — min 44×44px hit target, min 3:1 contrast vs page bg
- **NEVER** — a static floating icon that covers primary content; bottom-right placement only (avoids conflicting with Intercom/Drift chat bubbles on left, avoids covering nav breadcrumbs)

Validator (`validate-back-to-top.mjs`): Playwright scrolls to `scrollY=1000`, asserts button visible + `aria-label="Back to top"` + click scrolls to 0 within 1s.

## Every accordion / collapsible / "Read More" (***SMOOTH HEIGHT + ARIA STATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every expandable card"***)

Every accordion panel MUST animate height smoothly:

- **Collapsed state** — `max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; opacity: 0`
- **Expanded state** — JS reads `panel.scrollHeight`, sets `max-height: panel.scrollHeight + 'px'; opacity: 1` with transition `max-height .3s cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1), opacity .2s ease`
- After `transitionend`, set `max-height: none` (prevents cropping on dynamic content resize)

The trigger MUST have `aria-expanded="false"` (collapsed) / `aria-expanded="true"` (expanded) toggled on every click. Panel MUST have matching `aria-hidden="true"/"false"` and `role="region"` + `aria-labelledby="<trigger-id>"`.

### Keyboard

- `Enter`/`Space` — toggles
- `Escape` — collapses and returns focus to trigger

Animation disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (instant toggle). NEVER `display:none/block` toggle (ARIA `hidden` is the correct mechanism AND allows transition).

Validator (`validate-accordion-aria.mjs`): Playwright clicks every `[aria-expanded]` button, asserts panel height grows from 0 AND `aria-expanded` toggles AND panel `aria-hidden` toggles AND content visible after animation.

## Every modal dialog (***FOCUS TRAP + RESTORATION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — WCAG 2.4.3***)

Every modal/dialog (`role="dialog"`, `role="alertdialog"`, lightbox, mobile menu overlay) MUST:

- (a) Trap Tab cycle inside modal while open — Tab at last focusable returns to first, Shift+Tab at first returns to last
- (b) On open, move focus to first focusable inside modal OR the dialog element itself (`dialog.focus()`)
- (c) On close, return focus EXACTLY to the DOM element that triggered the open (store reference: `const trigger = document.activeElement` before opening)
- (d) Block background scroll via `document.body.style.cssText = "position:fixed;..."` pattern per lightbox scroll-preservation rule
- (e) Respond to Esc key to close

Native `<dialog>` element preferred (browser handles some of this natively with `showModal()`). Polyfill with `a11y-dialog` for custom implementations.

Validator (`validate-modal-focus-trap.mjs`): Playwright opens each dialog/lightbox, presses Tab × 10, asserts focus stays within modal bounds at all times; then closes via Esc, asserts focus returned to trigger element.

Fail codes: `a11y.focus_escapes_modal` | `a11y.focus_not_restored`.

## Every form (***ASSOCIATED LABELS + AUTOCOMPLETE + LOADING STATE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>` MUST:

- (a) Have an explicit `<label for="input-id">` (NEVER placeholder-only — placeholder disappears on focus, fails WCAG 1.3.1)
- (b) Have appropriate `autocomplete` attribute: `given-name`, `family-name`, `email`, `tel`, `organization`, `street-address`, `postal-code`, `cc-number` etc.
- (c) Have `aria-required="true"` when required (not just `required` HTML attr — some AT don't announce)

### Submit button MUST

- Show a spinner + `aria-busy="true"` + `disabled` while the request is in-flight — NEVER allow double-submit
- **On success** — replace form with a success message that tells the user the next step (`"Thanks, Jane! We'll respond within 24 hours. Check your inbox for a confirmation."`)
- **On error** — display inline field errors via `aria-describedby` linked to `<span role="alert">` per field, NOT just a generic toast

Every form gets invisible Turnstile CAPTCHA (`data-appearance="interaction-only"`) per always.md "Every form" rule.

Validator (`validate-form-accessibility.mjs`): for every `<form>`, assert every `<input>:not([type="hidden"])` has a `<label>` or `aria-label`, every field has `autocomplete` attr, submit button has loading-state implementation (spinner class or `aria-busy`).

## Every `<table>` (***CAPTION + SCOPE HEADERS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every `<table>` MUST have:

- (a) `<caption>` element as first child (describes what the table shows — visible text, NOT `aria-label` on the table)
- (b) Column headers as `<th scope="col">` in `<thead><tr>`
- (c) Row headers (when present) as `<th scope="row">` in each `<tbody><tr>`
- (d) Complex tables with multiple header rows MUST use `id`/`headers` linking: `<th id="h1">…</th>` paired with `<td headers="h1 h2">…</td>`

Striped rows via CSS `tbody tr:nth-child(even) { background: var(--row-alt) }`. Responsive reflow at mobile: table stacks as definition-list cards via CSS `display: grid` with `data-label` attrs (per full-bleed rule).

Validator (`validate-table-accessibility.mjs`): grep dist/ for `<table` — assert every table has `<caption>`, every `<th>` has `scope` attribute, no `<td>` exists in `<thead>`.

## Every SVG icon (***ACCESSIBLE LABELING — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every `<svg>` that conveys meaningful information (not purely decorative) MUST have:

- `role="img"` on the `<svg>` element
- `<title id="icon-[name]-title">Descriptive text</title>` as first child
- `aria-labelledby="icon-[name]-title"` on the `<svg>` element

Every decorative `<svg>` (used only for visual effect alongside text) MUST have `aria-hidden="true"` AND `focusable="false"` (IE11 compat).

### Pattern examples

- **Informative** — `<svg role="img" aria-labelledby="icon-email-title"><title id="icon-email-title">Send email</title>…</svg>`
- **Decorative** — `<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">…</svg>`

SVGs inside `<button>` or `<a>` where the parent already has accessible text: ALWAYS decorative pattern.

Validator (`validate-svg-accessibility.mjs`): for every `<svg>` NOT inside `<button>/<a>` with visible text — assert either `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"` OR `role="img" aria-labelledby` present.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #1 — CONTAINER QUERIES OVER MEDIA QUERIES — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Component-level responsive layouts MUST use CSS Container Queries (`container-type: inline-size; @container (min-width: 640px)`) — NOT viewport media queries — for any component that can appear in multiple layout slots (cards, sidebars, modals, asides). Media queries reserved ONLY for global page layout (nav collapse, sidebar drawer trigger).

Pattern:

```css
.card { container-type: inline-size; }
@container (min-width: 400px) { .card-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; } }
```

Validator (`validate-container-queries.mjs`): assert `@container` rule count ≥ 3 in `dist/**/*.css` AND any component CSS using width-based responsive logic uses `@container` not `@media (min-width:)`.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #2 — :has() PARENT SELECTORS REPLACE JS CLASS-TOGGLING — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST use `:has()` parent selector for state-dependent styling instead of JS class-toggling where CSS suffices.

Examples:

```css
form:has(input:invalid) .submit-btn { opacity: 0.5 }
.card:has(img[data-loading="true"]) { background: skeleton-gradient }
nav:has(.menu-open) .backdrop { display: block }
```

Eliminates entire categories of JS state mirroring.

Validator (`validate-has-selector.mjs`): assert ≥2 `:has(` occurrences in `dist/**/*.css` AND no JS `classList.add('is-invalid'|'is-loading'|'is-open')` patterns where `:has()` could replace them.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #42 (2026-05-10) — Chrome 105+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox 121+.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #3 — @STARTING-STYLE FOR ENTER ANIMATIONS — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every component that enters the DOM (dialog opening, popover showing, list item adding, route content mounting) MUST use `@starting-style` rule for enter animation — NOT JS-orchestrated requestAnimationFrame double-rAF hack.

Pattern:

```css
dialog { opacity: 1; @starting-style { opacity: 0; } }
```

Automatically transitions on insertion. Pair with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` for discrete property animations (display, visibility).

Validator (`validate-starting-style.mjs`): assert ≥2 `@starting-style` blocks in `dist/**/*.css` AND any modal/dialog/popover has paired enter transition.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #43 (2026-05-10) — Chrome 117+, Safari 17.5+.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #4 — text-wrap: balance + pretty — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site MUST set `text-wrap: balance` on ALL headings (h1-h6) AND `text-wrap: pretty` on ALL body paragraphs (p, li, blockquote). Replaces decades of manual `<br>` hacks and JS balance libraries.

CSS layer:

```css
@layer base {
  h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { text-wrap: balance }
  p,li,blockquote { text-wrap: pretty }
}
```

Validator (`validate-text-wrap.mjs`): assert global `text-wrap: balance` rule targeting headings AND `text-wrap: pretty` rule targeting body text in `dist/**/*.css`.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #44 (2026-05-10) — Chrome 114+ (balance), 117+ (pretty); Safari 17.5+.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #5 — OKLCH COLOR + COLOR-MIX — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every site's color palette MUST use OKLCH (`oklch(70% 0.15 240)`) — NOT hex/RGB/HSL — for design tokens. Hover/active/disabled variants derived via `color-mix(in oklch, var(--accent) 80%, transparent)` — NOT hand-tuned hex pairs. Perceptually uniform = consistent contrast across hue rotation. Hex emitted only at compile time for legacy fallback via PostCSS plugin.

Validator (`validate-oklch-colors.mjs`): assert design-token CSS file uses `oklch(` ≥10 times AND ≥3 `color-mix(in oklch,` declarations for state variants.

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #45 (2026-05-10) — Chrome 111+, Safari 15.4+, Firefox 113+.

## Every site (***LATEST-TECH EXPERIENCE #6 — NATIVE CSS NESTING (no Sass) — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every component CSS MUST use native CSS nesting (`.card { & h2 { ... } &:hover { ... } &[data-state="loading"] { ... } }`) — NEVER ship Sass/Less/Stylus preprocessor. PostCSS only for `oklch→hex` legacy fallback + CSS minification. Eliminates entire build-tool category.

Validator (`validate-native-nesting.mjs`): assert nested CSS blocks in `dist/**/*.css` parsed by browser-native CSS parser (no Sass `$var` or `@mixin` artifacts).

Reference: prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #46 (2026-05-10) — Chrome 112+, Safari 16.5+, Firefox 117+; baseline 2024.
