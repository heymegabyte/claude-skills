# 09 — Build-Breaking Brand + Content Rules

> **Model migration note (pass-79, 2026-06-09)**: `DALL-E` → **GPT Image 1.5** + `GPT-4o` → **GPT Image 2 vision**. Per `platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations`.

Migrated from `~/.claude/rules/always.md` 2026-05-03.

## Every social link

Hover / focus / active swaps to official brand hex:

- **FB** — `#1877F2`
- **LinkedIn** — `#0A66C2`
- **X** — `#000`
- **Instagram** — gradient `#F58529 → #DD2A7B → #8134AF → #515BD4`
- **YT** — `#FF0000`
- **TikTok** — `#000` with cyan / magenta dual-shadow
- **Pinterest** — `#BD081C`
- **GitHub** — `#181717`
- **Discord** — `#5865F2`
- **Bluesky** — `#0085FF`
- **Threads** — `#000`
- **WhatsApp** — `#25D366`
- **Reddit** — `#FF4500`
- **Snap** — `#FFFC00`

Encode as `social-brand-hex.json` map shipped in template — never hardcode generic accent. See `social-brand-hex.md`.

## Every site (small text contrast — ***WCAG AAA FOR SMALL TEXT***)

- Any text ≤14px MUST contrast ≥7:1 vs its background (WCAG AAA for small text)
- Body small text muted ONLY at full WCAG-AA (≥4.5:1)
- **Forbidden:** muted-foreground on muted-background pairing for small text
- **Build gate:** visual-qa samples computed-style of `font-size ≤ 14px` elements + bg, fails if contrast <7:1

**Reference incident:** the /services small-print incident on lone-mountain-global-3 (2026-05-01) — small descriptive text rendered too close to bg color, illegible — drove this rule.

## Every logo render (***LOGO-VS-CONTAINER CONTRAST — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

- Every logo render (header, footer, hero, modal, splash, mobile menu, sidebar) MUST contrast its container background by ≥4.5:1 measured on the logo's dominant chroma (NOT the transparent pixels)

### Forbidden pairings

- White-text-logo on white / cream bg
- Dark-text-logo on dark / navy bg
- Low-saturation-logo on same-hue bg

### Resolution

- Header AND footer themes are CHOSEN AFTER logo luminance scan (skill 09 `logo-luminance-drives-theme`)
- When dual-theme site (light header + dark footer or vice versa) needs the SAME logo, ship TWO logo files (`brand-mark-light.svg` for dark bg, `brand-mark-dark.svg` for light bg) and CSS `picture` / `<source media>` swaps based on container

### Validator (`validate-logo-contrast.mjs`)

GPT Image 2 vision samples logo bbox + container computed bg at 6bp, fails if contrast <4.5:1.

**Reference incident:** the lone-mountain-global-3 (2026-05-01) header rendered white-text-logo on white bg (invisible) AND footer rendered dark-text-logo on dark bg (invisible) — both invisible — drove this rule.

## Every hero (***HERO TEXT CONTRAST SCRIM — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Hero / page-banner backgrounds (image, video, gradient) MUST guarantee ≥4.5:1 contrast for ALL hero text via mandatory scrim overlay.

### Pattern

```css
.hero::before { content:""; position:absolute; inset:0; background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,.45) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,.65) 100%); z-index:1 }
.hero > .hero-content { position:relative; z-index:2 }
```

For dark text on light / bright bg, invert to white-overlay.

### Scrim opacity tuned per bg luminance

- Bright bg — 55-70% scrim
- Mid bg — 35-50% scrim
- Dark bg — 25-35% scrim

### Companion

- `text-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5)` on hero h1 + subhead as belt-and-suspenders
- NEVER ship hero text directly on raw image without scrim

### Validator

visual-qa samples hero text + computed-bg-after-scrim at 6bp, fails if contrast <4.5:1.

**Reference incident:** the lone-mountain-global-3 (2026-05-01) hero rendered text on insufficiently-darkened bg drove this rule.

## Every nav / header / footer logo render (***LOGO TRANSPARENT-BG VARIANT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — extends "Every logo render"***)

When source logo PNG / JPG has a baked-in solid background (white card, colored stripe, gradient bar) AND the rebuild's nav / header / footer surface DIFFERS from that baked bg, the build MUST produce a transparent-bg logo variant before render.

### Pipeline

1. Detect source logo bg via Sharp `getDominantColor` + edge-pixel sample at 5px inset — if ≥80% of border pixels share a single hue, logo has baked bg
2. Auto-strip via `sharp(logo).removeAlpha().threshold(...)` OR remove.bg API (`REMOVEBG_API_KEY`) for hard cases (anti-aliased edges, drop shadows, gradient bgs)
3. Ship `brand-mark-transparent.png` + `brand-mark-transparent.svg` (when SVG available) alongside `brand-mark.png`
4. `<picture><source srcset="brand-mark-transparent.png" media="(--surface-bg: transparent)"><img src="brand-mark.png"></picture>` with CSS `--surface-bg` custom property set per surface

### Context rules

- Header on white nav → transparent variant
- Header on dark hero → dark-bg variant
- Footer on dark band → light-text variant
- Three files, three contexts, never one PNG fighting all three

### Validator (`validate-logo-transparent-variant.mjs`)

For every site whose source logo has detected baked bg, assert `public/brand-mark-transparent.png` exists AND header `<img>` references transparent variant when nav bg-luminance differs from logo baked-bg luminance by ≥0.3.

**Reference incident:** njsk.org rebuild (2026-05-02) shipped white-card-bg logo on white nav (logo box visibly clashed with nav surface) — drove this rule.

## Every X (formerly Twitter) reference (***X-NOT-TWITTER + LATEST X ICON — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

EVERY mention / icon / aria-label / alt-text / social-row tile referencing the social network formerly known as Twitter MUST use the current "X" branding (text="X", icon=current X logo SVG, brand color=`#000` with cyan / magenta dual-shadow on hover per "Every social link" rule).

### Forbidden text strings in dist/ HTML + ARIA

- "Twitter" (except in historical context like "formerly Twitter")
- "Tweet" (except as past-tense verb in dated content)
- "@" mentions style

### Forbidden icons

- The blue Twitter bird SVG (path data with `tw-bird` etc.)
- `simple-icons:twitter`
- `lucide-twitter`

### Required

- `simple-icons:x` OR custom inline SVG of the X mark

  ```html
  <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M18.244 2.25h3.308l-7.227 8.26 8.502 11.24H16.17l-5.214-6.817L4.99 21.75H1.68l7.73-8.835L1.254 2.25H8.08l4.713 6.231zm-1.161 17.52h1.833L7.084 4.126H5.117z"/></svg>
  ```

- `aria-label` MUST be "X (formerly Twitter)" on first mention (for screen readers + SEO context) then plain "X" on repeat

### Validator (`validate-x-not-twitter.mjs`)

Grep dist/ for `\bTwitter\b`, `tweet`, `tw-bird`, blue twitter-bird SVG path; fail on any match outside whitelisted contexts (`<time datetime>` in archived blog posts, dated quotes, "formerly Twitter" parenthetical).

**Reference incident:** nyfoldingbox.com rebuild (2026-05-02) shipped Twitter-bird icon + "Follow us on Twitter" copy — drove this rule.

## Every bio mentioning notable institutions

BU | Harvard | MIT | Stanford | Oxford | Cambridge | Yale | Princeton | Columbia | UPenn | Cornell | Brown | Dartmouth | Caltech | UChicago | Northwestern | Duke | JHU | UMich | UCLA | UCB | CMU | T20 — credentials row with high-res transparent-PNG institution logos.

**Fetch chain:** Logo.dev → Wikipedia Commons SVG → Brandfetch.

## Every section with multiple CTAs (***PRIMARY vs SECONDARY VISUAL DISTINCTION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every content section MUST have AT MOST one primary CTA (filled button, high-contrast, brand-accent background, white text) and optionally one secondary CTA (outlined button, transparent / ghost style, accent border + accent text). NEVER two primary CTAs in the same visual space — they compete, confuse hierarchy, and reduce click-through on both.

### Design tokens

- **Primary CTA** — `background: var(--brand-accent); color: var(--bg-primary); border: none; font-weight: 700; padding: .75rem 1.75rem; border-radius: var(--radius-btn, 6px)`
- **Secondary CTA** — `background: transparent; color: var(--brand-accent); border: 1.5px solid var(--brand-accent); font-weight: 600`

### Rules

- Hover states both required (per 4-state interactive rule)
- Icon `→` or `↗` on primary CTA; no icon on secondary
- **Mobile stacking** — CTAs in a flex row wrap to column on `<576px` — primary always comes first (top) when stacked
- **Special** — hero section MAY have a video / tour secondary action rendered as `<button role="button" aria-label="Watch overview video">▶ Watch 2-min overview</button>` styled as ghost / secondary

### Validator (`validate-cta-hierarchy.mjs`)

For each `<section>`, count elements matching `[class*="btn-primary"]`, `[data-variant="primary"]` — assert count ≤1; assert any second CTA in same section has distinct visual weight (border-only or text-link style).

**Reference incident:** nyfoldingbox homepage every section had two identically-styled "GET STARTED" + "LEARN MORE" buttons — same size, same weight, same color — zero hierarchy — drove this rule.

## Every testimonial (***COMPLETE ATTRIBUTION — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every testimonial / review / quote rendered on the site MUST include:

1. `<blockquote>` semantic element with `cite` attribute set to the source URL when available
2. `<cite>` element wrapping — person first + last name (MANDATORY), their job title / role (MANDATORY), their company / organization name (MANDATORY when a business context exists — NOT optional)
3. **Avatar** — source photo ≥40×40px → GPT Image 1.5 representative headshot → initials monogram badge (bg = brand-accent, text = bg-primary, 2 initials from name)
4. **Date of testimonial** (year minimum: "2024") when derivable from source
5. **Star rating** (1-5) when source had one

### NEVER anonymous testimonials

- `"— Happy Customer"` — FORBIDDEN
- `"— Anonymous"` — FORBIDDEN
- `"— Satisfied Client"` — FORBIDDEN

If source quote lacks attribution, use `"[Name withheld by request] · Verified customer · 2024"` pattern.

### Validator (`validate-testimonial-attribution.mjs`)

Every `<blockquote>` must contain `<cite>` with length >10 AND cite text must NOT match regex `/(anonymous|happy customer|satisfied client|a customer)/i`.

**Reference incident:** nyfoldingbox source testimonials had partial attribution ("— Mike, NJ") — rebuild stripped even that, showing bare quotes — drove this rule.

## Every external link in body content (***OPENS NEW TAB + EXTERNAL INDICATOR — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every `<a href>` pointing to an external domain (not `window.location.hostname`) in body content (article body, service descriptions, about page prose, publication lists) MUST:

1. `target="_blank"` so the user's reading context is preserved
2. `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (security — prevents `window.opener` exploitation, privacy — strips referrer)
3. Small external-link indicator icon AFTER the link text (never before) — SVG 12×12 `<span aria-hidden="true" class="ext-link-icon">↗</span>` OR the `simple-icons:externallink` icon — so users know the link leaves the site before clicking
4. `aria-label="[link text] (opens in new tab)"` on the `<a>` element so screen readers announce the behavior

### Exception

Navigation links in header / footer to known sister sites (same organization's other properties) — these may open in same tab.

### Build gate

Grep dist/ HTML for `<a href="http` without `target="_blank"` in `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section data-content>` — any match = fail.

### Validator (`validate-external-links.mjs`)

Every `<a>` with external href in content area has `target="_blank"` AND `rel` contains `noopener` AND sibling `<span class="ext-link-icon">` exists.

**Reference incident:** both sites linked publications / journals in body text that opened in same tab — navigating away from publications page with no back-context — drove this rule.

## Every Schema.org `@type` selection (***BUSINESS-CLASS GATING — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

`LocalBusiness` (and its subtypes: Restaurant, Dentist, MedicalBusiness, Store, AutoRepair, BeautySalon, HealthClub, etc.) MUST be reserved for businesses where customers physically visit a fixed-address premises for the primary service.

### Allowlist for `@type=LocalBusiness`

- Storefront retail
- Restaurant / cafe / bar
- Medical / dental / veterinary clinic
- Salon / spa / barbershop
- Gym / yoga studio
- Auto repair / dealership
- Hotel / lodging
- Attorneys / CPAs with walk-in office
- Real estate brokerage with walk-in office

Everything else (consulting practice, advocacy non-profit, professional services rendered remotely, software / SaaS company, agency, online retailer, research institute, foundation, association) MUST use `@type=Organization` (or its subtypes: NGO for non-profit, Corporation, EducationalOrganization, GovernmentOrganization).

### Implementation

- Build prompts MUST classify business class BEFORE schema render (skill 02 founder / business inference)
- Output `_research.json.business_class` ∈ `storefront | restaurant | medical | salon | gym | auto-repair | hotel | legal-walkin | real-estate-walkin | organization | nonprofit | saas | portfolio | agency | research | foundation`
- Template helper `buildBusinessJsonLd({ businessClass })` (`src/lib/businessSchema.ts`) emits the correct `@type` from the class — never inline `@type: 'LocalBusiness'` in page source

### Validator (`validate-schema-type.mjs`)

Grep dist HTML for `"@type":"LocalBusiness"` (or its subtypes) — assert `_research.json.business_class` is in the local-business allowlist; otherwise = fail.

**Reference incident:** lonemountainglobal.projectsites.dev (2026-05-07) — global health consulting practice rendered as `@type=LocalBusiness` with no street address (advocacy work happens in WHO offices, hospitals, ministries, conferences across continents) — the wrong schema type signals to Google + AI search that this is a walk-in business, suppresses authority signal, fails E-E-A-T. Drove this rule.

## Every site with named founder / principal (***PERSON JSON-LD — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — applies to consulting, portfolio, professional services, founder-led SaaS, non-profits with named director***)

Every site that names an individual as founder / principal / lead / director / author on the homepage or `/about` MUST emit a `Person` JSON-LD entry on the page where they are named, with:

- `name` (MANDATORY)
- `jobTitle` (MANDATORY)
- `worksFor: { '@type': 'Organization', name }` (MANDATORY when an org is named)
- `url` (the person's page or external profile)
- `image` (headshot when available)
- `alumniOf` (when education credentials are stated)
- `sameAs` (LinkedIn, ORCID, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, X/twitter, GitHub, Mastodon — every public profile findable via web research)
- `description` (2-3 sentence bio)
- `knowsAbout` (their stated specialties as keyword array)

### Required for every named individual

Founder, co-founder, executive director, principal, partner, sole proprietor, author of a portfolio.

Template ships `<PersonJsonLd>` component — never hand-write Person JSON-LD inline.

### Validator (`validate-person-jsonld.mjs`)

For every dist HTML page that renders an `<h1>` / `<h2>` containing a person's name (proper-noun First + Last detected via NER) accompanied by a job title within 100 characters, assert at least one `<script type="application/ld+json">` block of `@type=Person` with matching `name`. Missing = fail.

**Reference incident:** lonemountainglobal — homepage named the founder as global health expert with 30+ years, but emitted zero Person JSON-LD; AI search engines + Google Knowledge Graph had no structured signal connecting the org to the principal.

## Every publication / article / news render (***SCHOLARLY ARTICLE OR ARTICLE JSON-LD — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every publication, journal article, blog post, news item, white paper, or thought-leadership piece rendered on the site MUST emit:

- `@type=ScholarlyArticle` (peer-reviewed or academic)
- OR `@type=BlogPosting` (blog)
- OR `@type=NewsArticle` (news)
- OR `@type=Article` (default fallback)

JSON-LD with:

- `headline`
- `url`
- `datePublished` (ISO 8601)
- `dateModified`
- `author: [{ @type: Person, name, url? }]`
- `publisher: { @type: Organization, name, logo? }`
- `mainEntityOfPage: { @type: WebPage, @id: url }`
- `inLanguage`
- `keywords` (when available)
- `citation: [{ @type: CreativeWork, name, url }]` for every external source cited (boosts AI-citation rate per Brewer 2024)

Template ships `<ArticleJsonLd>` component covering all four type variants.

### Validator (`validate-article-jsonld.mjs`)

Every route matching `/blog/*`, `/publications/*`, `/news/*`, `/research/*`, `/articles/*`, `/papers/*`, `/case-studies/*` MUST emit one of the four article types in JSON-LD; missing = fail; missing `author` + `datePublished` + `publisher` = fail.

**Reference:** lonemountainglobal listed publications inline on /about with no per-publication JSON-LD; AI search citation rate from such pages drops below 30% per Brewer (2024).

## Every page on a research-bearing site (***STYLIZED APA REFERENCES — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — applies to non-profits, professional services, research/advocacy orgs, founder-led portfolios, news/blog/publication routes, every multi-page institutional site***)

Almost every page (≥80% of routes) on a generated site MUST surface 3-10 APA-7th-ed references rendered through the shared `<PageReferences refs={...} />` component AND ≥1 inline `<Citation refId="...">claim text</Citation>` superscript link per page section that makes a quantitative / factual claim.

### Drive

- Research-grade authority signal
- AI-search citation lift (16% → 54% per Brewer 2024)
- E-E-A-T compliance
- Defends against the rebuild "looking AI-generated" smell

### Pipeline per page

1. BEFORE rewriting copy, spawn a focused research agent that mines 5-10 APA-cited claims from peer-reviewed / .gov / .edu / primary sources matching the page's topic
2. Write `src/data/citations/<slug>.ts` exporting `{ id, apa, url, type }` reference array
3. Inject `<Citation refId>` superscript markers around each quantitative claim in the page body
4. Render `<PageReferences slug="<slug>" />` at the bottom of the page (above footer) — stylized with hanging-indent, monospace refId chip, hover-reveal abstract excerpt, copy-citation button per ref

### Exemptions (allowed to skip)

- Pure transactional routes (`/checkout`, `/cart`, `/login`, `/signup`)
- Interactive tools (`/contact` form, `/admin`)
- Pure-listing pages whose sub-routes carry citations (`/blog` index — its children carry them)

### Required pages

Home, about, services, donate, we-need, volunteer, faq, team, annual-report, financials, testimonials, press, blog-post — basically every page with substantive prose or claims.

### Page-level minimums

- Home — 3+ refs
- About — 8+ refs (history-heavy)
- Services — 5+ refs
- Donate — 5+ refs (donation tax law + impact research)
- Financials / annual-report — 5+ refs (sector benchmarks)
- Press — 3+ refs (media kit credibility)
- FAQ — 5+ refs (each statistical answer cited)

### Stylized rendering REQUIRED — never a bare `<ol>` of plain text

Mandatory visual treatment:

- Monospace refId chip (e.g. `[smith24]` in `var(--font-mono)`)
- APA-correct hanging indent (4ch)
- Italic journal / book titles
- Hover state expands to show 1-line abstract (preserved from research JSON)
- Copy-link button per ref using `navigator.clipboard.writeText(apa)`
- Accordion collapse on mobile
- Intersection-observer fade-in

Component lives at `src/components/page-references.tsx` (shipped in template).

### Validator (`validate-stylized-citations.mjs`)

For every route in `_routes.json` NOT in the exemption list, assert ≥3 entries in `src/data/citations/<slug>.ts` AND ≥1 `<Citation` JSX call in the page source AND `<PageReferences` rendered.

**Reference incident:** njsk.org first audit pass (2026-05-11) shipped 14 newly-rewritten pages with claims like "97 cents on the dollar," "23.4% of Newark residents live below poverty line," "1 in 4 children goes to bed hungry" — every number unsourced — passing the eye test but failing E-E-A-T + AI-citation tests.

**Brian:** *"audit and completely improve every single URL with parallel agents by leveraging heavy web research and leveraging gorgeous + beautiful + stylized APA references on as many pages as possible, in fact, almost all pages."* Drove this rule.

**Companion:** `rules/citations.md` (universal APA format) + skill 03-planning-and-research (research agent template).

## Every site with analytics (***COOKIE CONSENT BANNER — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING — GDPR + CCPA***)

Every site that loads third-party analytics (GA4, PostHog, GTM, Hotjar, Meta Pixel, etc.) MUST render a cookie consent banner on first visit:

1. Renders as a bottom-bar or bottom-corner modal — NEVER full-screen block
2. Minimum message — "We use analytics to improve your experience. [Accept All] [Manage Preferences] [Reject Non-Essential]" — all three options visible (GDPR Article 7 requires as-easy-to-withdraw-as-to-give consent)
3. Clicking "Accept All" sets `localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'all')` and initializes analytics
4. Clicking "Reject Non-Essential" sets `localStorage.setItem('cookie-consent', 'essential-only')` and blocks all analytics from loading (NEVER load GA4 / PostHog before consent in EU)
5. Banner NEVER auto-dismissed (user must make a choice)
6. Banner NEVER shows again after a choice is stored
7. "Manage Preferences" opens a modal with per-category toggles (Analytics, Marketing, Functional) with descriptions

### Implementation

`src/lib/consent.ts` template module — checks localStorage on load, conditionally initializes analytics only when consent is `'all'` or relevant category enabled. PostHog uses `persistence: 'localStorage'` (cookie-free, no consent required in some jurisdictions — still behind consent gate for GDPR).

### Validator (`validate-cookie-consent.mjs`)

Playwright clears localStorage, loads homepage, asserts `[data-cookie-banner]` visible within 2s AND has ≥2 interactive choice buttons.

**Reference incident:** both sites loaded PostHog + GTM on first load before any consent — GDPR violation for EU visitors — drove this rule.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #1 — LOGO PIXEL-MATCH VALIDATOR — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Source-site logo extraction MUST produce a logo asset whose perceptual hash (pHash) differs ≤8 from the original — proven match by visual signature, not human spot-check.

### Pipeline

Wayback + live source crawl → find largest logo asset → SVG-preferred → transparent PNG fallback → upload to R2 `assets/brand/logo.{svg,png}`.

### Validator (`validate-logo-fidelity.mjs`)

Compute pHash of source `_brand.json.logo.source_url` vs dist `assets/brand/logo.*`, fail if Hamming distance >8. Regenerate via Ideogram v3 ONLY when source logo is unrecoverable (404, redirect-loop, <64px) AND record `_brand.json.warnings: ["logo_regenerated_no_source"]`.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #17 (2026-05-10) — LMG iter-4 regression: pipeline shipped Ideogram-regenerated logo while source SVG was 200-OK; fidelity = legitimacy.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #2 — FONT-FAMILY EXTRACTION FROM SOURCE COMPUTED-STYLE — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Source-site computed-style sniff via Playwright MUST extract actual body + headline font-family stacks — NOT inferred from category or guessed by LLM.

### Pipeline

Playwright loads source URL → `getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('h1'))` + `body` → write `_brand.json.fonts: { headline, body, mono?, sources: [google|adobe|self-hosted] }`.

Headline + body MUST match source within Google Fonts catalog OR self-hosted woff2.

### Validator (`validate-font-fidelity.mjs`)

Grep dist `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=...">` against `_brand.json.fonts.{headline,body}`, fail on missing or mismatched.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #18 (2026-05-10) — LMG iter-4 regression: source uses Poppins + Hind, pipeline shipped Inter + Roboto.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #3 — PRIMARY + SECONDARY COLOR EXTRACTION FROM LOGO + HERO — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Brand color extraction MUST run TWO passes:

1. GPT Image 2 vision call against source homepage screenshot → returns `primary, secondary, accent, bg_dark, bg_light` hex array
2. `node-vibrant` / `Vibrant.js` color-thief on extracted logo PNG → returns palette

**Merge:** vision-pass wins for primary / accent; vibrant wins for backgrounds. Result written to `_brand.json.colors.{primary,secondary,accent,bg,fg,muted}`.

### Validator (`validate-brand-colors.mjs`)

Assert `_brand.json.colors.primary` differs ≤ΔE 5 from source-site primary (per CIE Lab) AND no color is hand-guessed.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #19 (2026-05-10) — njsk.org burgundy incident (LLM guessed `#1e3a8a` blue from "Catholic" category, actual `#6b1d2e` burgundy).

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #4 — CONTENT CORPUS DELTA — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Source-site content corpus (all body text per page) MUST be preserved with delta ≤15% — measured by Jaccard similarity of token-bag per route.

### Rules

- Build cannot rewrite >15% of source paragraphs except (a) banned-word substitution per copy-writing rules, (b) explicit user-requested rewrite

### Pipeline

Squarespace / Wix / WP crawl → strip nav + footer chrome → token-bag per route → write `_content_corpus.json.{path → tokens[]}`.

### Validator (`validate-content-fidelity.mjs`)

For each rebuilt route, compute Jaccard against `_content_corpus.json[path]`, fail if <0.85.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #20 (2026-05-10) — LMG iter-4 regression: rewrote 40% of "About" page in pipeline voice, lost authentic founder language.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #5 — INTERNAL ROUTE STRUCTURE PARITY — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Source-site internal route map MUST be preserved 1:1 in rebuild — every source URL becomes a real rendered route OR a 301 in `_redirects`.

### Pipeline

Deep-crawl source via sitemap.xml + recursive link discovery → write `_routes.json.{ source_path, rebuild_path, status: 200|301, redirect_target? }`.

### Validator (`validate-route-parity.mjs`)

Every entry in `_routes.json` resolves to a 200-OK rebuild HTML file OR appears in `_redirects` with target also 200-OK.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #21 (2026-05-10) — broken links from missing routes = SEO equity loss.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #6 — TONE-OF-VOICE VECTOR MATCH — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Source-site copy MUST be vectorized (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) per page; rebuild copy embedding MUST match source within cosine ≥0.78 — proves rebuild speaks in source's voice, not pipeline's generic voice.

### Pipeline

Source crawl → embed body text per route → write `_voice_embeddings.json`. After rebuild: embed rebuild body text per route → compare.

### Validator (`validate-voice-fidelity.mjs`)

Fail any route with cosine <0.78 against its source counterpart.

**Reference:** prompt-improvements brainstorm rec #22 (2026-05-10) — LMG iter-4: rebuild reads like SaaS landing page, source reads like founder essay; voice = brand.

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #7 — HERO IMAGE/VIDEO SOURCE-FIRST PRIORITY — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every rebuild hero (image OR video) MUST attempt source-site reuse FIRST — only fall back to Sora / GPT Image 1.5 / Pexels when source hero is unrecoverable.

### Pipeline

Crawl source hero → R2 self-host → place in `<picture>` / `<video>` hero slot. Source preserved at original aspect + composition; pipeline upgrades quality (upscale, sharpen, recompress to WebP / AVIF) but does NOT replace subject.

### Validator (`validate-hero-source-first.mjs`)

If source hero exists (`_media_extraction.json.hero_url` resolves 200), assert rebuild hero file is derived from same source (matching pHash or extracted from same URL).

## Every site rebuild (***BRAND FIDELITY #8 — DESIGN-TOKEN DIFF AS BUILD-OUTPUT ARTIFACT — UNIVERSAL — BUILD-BREAKING***)

Every rebuild MUST emit `_brand_diff.json` capturing per-token comparison: source-extracted vs rebuild-shipped (logo pHash, font family, color hex, typescale, spacing scale, radius). Diff surfaced in iteration log under `delight_moments[]` is NOT acceptable — diff MUST be in its own artifact, machine-readable, ready for human review.

### Validator (`validate-brand-diff.mjs`)

Assert `_brand_diff.json` exists + has fields `{logo_hash_distance, font_match, color_delta_e_max, token_delta_count}` AND a human-readable summary line per token.
